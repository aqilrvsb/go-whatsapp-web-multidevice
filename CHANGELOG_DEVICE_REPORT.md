# Device Report Fix - July 01, 2025

## Problem
- Device report showed correct data (8 total leads) but summary cards weren't clickable
- Users couldn't see all leads at once, only device-specific views
- No visual indication that summary cards could be clicked

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Changes (dashboard.html)
1. **Made Summary Cards Clickable**
   - Added `onclick` handlers to Total/Pending/Success/Failed cards
   - Added `cursor: pointer` style for visual feedback
   - Cards now respond to clicks with appropriate actions

2. **New Function: showAllCampaignLeads()**
   - Fetches leads from all devices in the campaign
   - Combines results into single view
   - Supports status filtering (all/pending/success/failed)
   - Shows device name for each lead

3. **Global State Management**
   - Added `currentDeviceReport` variable
   - Stores device report data for reuse
   - Prevents unnecessary API calls

### Backend Changes (app.go)
1. **Added Debug Logging**
   - Logs campaign ID and user ID
   - Logs device-wise lead counts
   - Logs final totals for verification

## How It Works Now

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Device Report" on campaign
2. Modal shows device breakdown with summary cards
3. User can now click:
   - **Summary cards** → See all leads from all devices
   - **Device table rows** → See leads from specific device

### API Calls
- Summary cards fetch from all devices: `/api/campaigns/:id/device/:deviceId/leads`
- Combines results client-side for unified view
- Maintains existing device-specific endpoints

## Testing
1. Click "Device Report" on any campaign
2. Verify total count displays correctly
3. Click blue "Total Leads" card
4. Verify all leads display in modal
5. Test Pending/Success/Failed filters

## Future Enhancements
Consider adding:
- Backend endpoint for all campaign leads (avoid multiple API calls)
- Export functionality for device reports
- Real-time updates for lead status changes
