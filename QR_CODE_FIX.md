// QR Code Connection Fix for WhatsApp Multi-Device

The issue with QR code not being detected by WhatsApp can be due to several reasons:

1. **WebSocket Connection Issue**
   - The WhatsApp client might not be properly connected to the WebSocket
   - Solution: Ensure the WebSocket is connected before generating QR

2. **QR Code Format Issue**
   - The QR code data might not be in the correct format
   - WhatsApp expects a specific format: "1@XXX,YYY,ZZZ==,platform"

3. **Store/Database Issue**
   - The device store might not be properly initialized
   - Check if the database is storing device information correctly

4. **Timing Issue**
   - The QR code might be expiring too quickly
   - Default timeout is 60 seconds, but it might need adjustment

IMMEDIATE WORKAROUNDS:

1. Try using Phone Code authentication instead:
   - Click "Phone Code" button
   - Enter your phone number (with country code)
   - Get the 8-character code
   - Use it in WhatsApp > Settings > Linked Devices > Link with phone number

2. Check server logs for any errors:
   - Look for "Error when write qr code to file"
   - Check for WebSocket connection errors
   - Verify database connection

3. Browser-side fixes:
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try incognito/private mode
   - Use a different browser
   - Disable ad blockers

4. WhatsApp app fixes:
   - Update WhatsApp to latest version
   - Clear WhatsApp cache
   - Try on a different phone

If QR code still doesn't work, the Phone Code method is more reliable.
