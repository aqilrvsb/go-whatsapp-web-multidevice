// This file shows the CORRECT pending-first logic that should be in sequence_trigger_processor.go

// Key changes needed:
// 1. ALL steps start as 'pending' (not 'active')
// 2. Remove the database trigger that prevents Step 2 activation
// 3. Process based on next_trigger_time, not activation chains

/*
CORRECT ENROLLMENT LOGIC:

for i, step := range steps {
    var nextTriggerTime time.Time
    var status string
    
    if i == 0 {
        // FIRST STEP: PENDING (not active!)
        nextTriggerTime = currentTime.Add(5 * time.Minute)
        status = "pending"  // <-- MUST BE PENDING
    } else {
        // Subsequent steps - also PENDING
        nextTriggerTime = previousTriggerTime.Add(time
