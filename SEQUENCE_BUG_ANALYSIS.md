# SEQUENCE PROCESSING BUG ANALYSIS - January 19, 2025

## The Problem:
When sequences run, ALL steps (1, 2, 3, 4) are being processed at once, ignoring:
- The 'pending' status (only step 1 should be 'active')
- The `next_trigger_time` delays (12, 24, 36 hours)

## Evidence:
1. All 60 messages were sent within 1 second
2. Step 2 was processed 12 hours EARLY
3. Step 3 was processed 24 hours EARLY  
4. Step 4 was processed 36 hours EARLY
5. All records show `current_step = 4` (already fixed)

## What SHOULD Happen:
```
Hour 0:   Step 1 (active) → Send → Mark completed → Activate Step 2
Hour 12:  Step 2 (active) → Send → Mark completed → Activate Step 3
Hour 24:  Step 3 (active) → Send → Mark completed → Activate Step 4
Hour 36:  Step 4 (active) → Send → Mark completed → Sequence done
```

## What's ACTUALLY Happening:
```
Hour 0: ALL steps (1,2,3,4) → Send ALL → Mark ALL completed
        (Ignoring status='pending' and future next_trigger_time)
```

## Debugging Added:
1. **Enrollment Logging**: Shows exactly what status and time each step gets
2. **Processing Logging**: Shows which records are being selected for processing
3. **Progress Logging**: Shows when next steps are activated

## Next Steps to Debug:

1. **Enable sequences again** and watch the logs for:
   ```
   - "Enrolling contact X in sequence Y with Z steps"
   - "INSERT: phone=X, step=Y, status=Z, trigger=A, next_time=B"
   - "Found X active sequence contacts ready for processing"
   - "Active contacts sample: [...]"
   ```

2. **Check if enrollment is correct**:
   - Step 1 should have status='active', next_time=NOW
   - Steps 2-4 should have status='pending', next_time=future

3. **Check if processing respects the query**:
   - Should only process records where:
     - status = 'active' AND
     - next_trigger_time <= NOW()

## Possible Root Causes:

1. **Database Trigger**: Maybe there's a trigger changing all statuses to 'active'
2. **Race Condition**: Multiple processors running simultaneously
3. **Query Bug**: The WHERE clause might not be working correctly
4. **Activation Bug**: When step 1 completes, it might activate ALL steps

## Temporary Workaround:
If the bug persists, we can add a hard check in the processor:
```go
// Only process if it's really time
if contact.NextTriggerTime.After(time.Now()) {
    logrus.Warnf("Skipping contact - not time yet: %v", contact.NextTriggerTime)
    continue
}
```

## To Verify Fix:
After re-enabling sequences, run:
```sql
-- Check enrollment
SELECT contact_phone, current_step, status, 
       next_trigger_time, current_trigger
FROM sequence_contacts
WHERE contact_phone IN (SELECT phone FROM leads LIMIT 1)
ORDER BY current_step;

-- Should see:
-- Step 1: status='active', next_time=now
-- Step 2: status='pending', next_time=now+12h
-- Step 3: status='pending', next_time=now+24h
-- Step 4: status='pending', next_time=now+36h
```
