## Sequence Processing Issues Found:

### 1. **Why current_step is always 4:**
The enrollment code is setting `current_step` to `step.DayNumber` (which is correct), but somewhere it's being overwritten to 4 for all records.

### 2. **Why all marked 'completed' at same time (delays NOT respected):**
- All 4 steps are enrolled at once when a lead matches the trigger
- First step is marked 'active', others 'pending'
- But they all got processed at the same time, ignoring the `next_trigger_time`

### 3. **The actual flow problems:**

#### During Enrollment (enrollContactInSequence):
```go
// Creates records for ALL steps at once
for i, step := range steps {
    // Calculate next_trigger_time based on cumulative delays
    // First step: immediate
    // Step 2: +12 hours
    // Step 3: +24 hours  
    // Step 4: +36 hours
    
    status := "pending"
    if i == 0 {
        status = "active"  // Only first step is active
    }
}
```

#### During Processing (processSequenceContacts):
The query looks for:
```sql
WHERE sc.status = 'active'
    AND sc.next_trigger_time <= NOW()
```

But after processing, it updates status to 'sent', not 'completed'.

#### The Real Issue:
After a message is sent, the code should:
1. Mark current step as 'completed'
2. Find and activate the next step (change from 'pending' to 'active')

But instead, all steps seem to have been processed at once.

### 4. **Messages were attempted but FAILED:**
- Messages show status: "failed" 
- Multiple retry attempts visible
- This explains why all marked completed - the system tried and failed

### Solutions Needed:
1. Fix the status update logic - should be 'completed' not 'sent'
2. Ensure only one step is 'active' at a time
3. Respect the trigger delays
4. Fix why messages are failing
