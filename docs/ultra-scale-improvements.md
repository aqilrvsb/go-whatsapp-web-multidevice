# Ultra-Scale Broadcast System Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the Ultra-Scale Broadcast System to enhance sequence visibility and make pool cleanup configurable.

## 1. Sequence Progress Tracking

### New Database Fields
Added progress tracking fields to the `sequences` table:
- `total_contacts` - Total number of contacts in the sequence
- `active_contacts` - Contacts currently receiving messages
- `completed_contacts` - Contacts who completed all steps
- `failed_contacts` - Contacts with failed messages
- `progress_percentage` - Overall completion percentage (0-100)
- `last_activity_at` - Last time any message was sent
- `estimated_completion_at` - Estimated completion timestamp

### Database Function
Created a PostgreSQL function `update_sequence_progress()` that:
- Calculates contact statistics
- Updates progress percentage
- Called automatically when messages are sent

### Usage
The progress is automatically updated when:
- Messages are sent successfully
- Messages fail
- Contacts complete sequences

### API Response
Sequences now include progress information:
```json
{
  "id": "sequence-123",
  "name": "Welcome Sequence",
  "progress_percentage": 67.5,
  "total_contacts": 1000,
  "active_contacts": 325,
  "completed_contacts": 675,
  "failed_contacts": 0,
  "last_activity_at": "2025-07-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 2. Configurable Pool Cleanup

### Environment Variables
New configuration options:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES` | 5 | Minutes to wait before cleaning up completed pools |
| `BROADCAST_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POOL` | 3000 | Maximum workers per broadcast pool |
| `BROADCAST_MAX_POOLS_PER_USER` | 10 | Maximum concurrent pools per user |
| `BROADCAST_WORKER_QUEUE_SIZE` | 1000 | Message buffer size per worker |
| `BROADCAST_COMPLETION_CHECK_SECONDS` | 10 | How often to check for completion |
| `BROADCAST_PROGRESS_LOG_SECONDS` | 30 | How often to log progress |

### Example Configuration
```bash
# For large campaigns that take hours
export BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES=60  # Keep pool for 1 hour after completion

# For quick test campaigns
export BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES=2   # Clean up after 2 minutes

# For high-frequency monitoring
export BROADCAST_COMPLETION_CHECK_SECONDS=5
export BROADCAST_PROGRESS_LOG_SECONDS=10
```

### Benefits
- **Memory Management**: Longer cleanup for large campaigns prevents premature cleanup
- **Flexibility**: Different environments can have different settings
- **Monitoring**: Adjustable progress reporting frequency

## 3. Implementation Details

### BroadcastConfig Structure
```go
type BroadcastConfig struct {
    PoolCleanupDuration     time.Duration
    MaxWorkersPerPool       int
    MaxPoolsPerUser         int
    WorkerQueueSize         int
    CompletionCheckInterval time.Duration
    ProgressLogInterval     time.Duration
}
```

### Usage in Code
The configuration is loaded on startup:
```go
config := config.GetBroadcastConfig()
// Uses environment variables or defaults
```

## 4. Monitoring & Debugging

### Sequence Progress Monitoring
- Check progress via API: `/api/sequences/{id}`
- Dashboard shows progress bars for active sequences
- Database query: `SELECT * FROM sequences WHERE progress_percentage < 100`

### Pool Cleanup Monitoring
- Logs show when pools are scheduled for cleanup
- Format: `"Scheduling pool cleanup for campaign:123 after 5m0s"`
- Cleanup completion logged: `"Cleaned up broadcast pool campaign:123"`

## 5. Best Practices

### For Sequence Management
1. Monitor `progress_percentage` to track completion
2. Use `last_activity_at` to detect stuck sequences
3. Check `failed_contacts` for quality issues

### For Pool Configuration
1. **Short campaigns** (< 100 contacts): 5-minute cleanup (default)
2. **Medium campaigns** (100-1000 contacts): 15-30 minute cleanup
3. **Large campaigns** (1000+ contacts): 60+ minute cleanup
4. **Testing**: 1-2 minute cleanup for quick iterations

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Sequence Progress Not Updating
- Check if migration ran: `SELECT * FROM migrations WHERE name LIKE '%sequence progress%'`
- Verify function exists: `SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'update_sequence_progress'`
- Check logs for SQL errors

### Pools Cleaning Up Too Early
- Increase `BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES`
- Check completion detection logic
- Monitor `completionTime` in pool status

### Memory Usage High
- Decrease `BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES`
- Reduce `BROADCAST_WORKER_QUEUE_SIZE`
- Monitor active pool count

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Real-time progress WebSocket updates
- Predictive completion time based on sending rate
- Automatic cleanup duration based on campaign size
- Pool recycling for similar broadcasts
