# üîß SIMPLE FIX FOR CAMPAIGNS

## The ONE LINE change needed in `optimized_campaign_trigger.go`:

### Find this section (around line 150-165):
```go
msg := domainBroadcast.BroadcastMessage{
    UserID:         campaign.UserID,
    DeviceID:       lead.DeviceID,
    CampaignID:     &campaign.ID,
    RecipientPhone: lead.Phone,
    RecipientName:  lead.Name,
    Type:           "text",
    Content:        campaign.Message,
    MediaURL:       campaign.ImageURL,
    ScheduledAt:    time.Now(),
    MinDelay:       campaign.MinDelaySeconds,  // ‚ùå DELETE THIS LINE
    MaxDelay:       campaign.MaxDelaySeconds,  // ‚ùå DELETE THIS LINE
}
```

### Change to:
```go
msg := domainBroadcast.BroadcastMessage{
    UserID:         campaign.UserID,
    DeviceID:       lead.DeviceID,
    CampaignID:     &campaign.ID,
    RecipientPhone: lead.Phone,
    RecipientName:  lead.Name,
    Type:           "text",
    Content:        campaign.Message,
    MediaURL:       campaign.ImageURL,
    ScheduledAt:    time.Now(),
    // Don't set MinDelay/MaxDelay here
}
```

## That's it! Just remove those 2 lines.

## Why this works:

1. **Campaign creates broadcast_message** with `campaign_id` ‚úÖ
2. **Broadcast processor** reads the message and JOINs with campaigns table to get delays ‚úÖ
3. **Worker** applies the delays when sending ‚úÖ

The broadcast processor (`ultra_optimized_broadcast_processor.go`) already does this correctly:

```sql
LEFT JOIN campaigns c ON bm.campaign_id = c.id
...
COALESCE(c.min_delay_seconds, 5) as min_delay,
COALESCE(c.max_delay_seconds, 15) as max_delay,
```

## Result:
- Campaigns will work exactly like sequences
- Delays come from campaigns table, not broadcast_messages
- No database changes needed
- Sequences remain untouched
