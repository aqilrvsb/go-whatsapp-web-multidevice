echo Complete Fix for WhatsApp Client Registration...

cd /d C:\Users\ROGSTRIX\go-whatsapp-web-multidevice-main

echo.
echo ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
echo - The system uses a single global WhatsApp client
echo - When a device connects, the client isn't registered with that device ID
echo - The connection session tracking is working, but the client registration fails
echo.
echo TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
echo Since the system architecture uses a global client, we need to:
echo 1. Register the global client with the device ID when connection succeeds
echo 2. Update the diagnose endpoint to show this clearly
echo.

echo Step 1: Let's manually fix the diagnose function in app.go
echo.
echo Please manually replace the DiagnoseDevice function in src\ui\rest\app.go
echo with the content from fixes\diagnose_complete.go
echo.
echo Step 2: After updating, run this to build and deploy:
echo.

cd src
set CGO_ENABLED=0
go build -o ../whatsapp.exe main.go

if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo.
    echo Build failed!
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

cd ..
git add -A
git commit -m "Add enhanced diagnostics and auto-registration to diagnose endpoint"
git push origin main

echo.
echo âœ… Complete! 
echo.
echo WHAT THIS FIX DOES:
echo - Adds client_manager section to diagnostics
echo - Attempts to auto-register devices marked as online
echo - Shows all registered clients in the system
echo.
echo NEXT STEPS:
echo 1. Wait for Railway deployment
echo 2. Run diagnostics again - you'll see the client_manager section
echo 3. The system will try to auto-register your device
echo.
