# Sequence Process - Missing Components

## ❌ Issues Found:

### 1. **Sequences Don't Use Database Queue**
```go
// Current (WRONG):
s.broadcastMgr.SendMessage(broadcastMsg)  // Direct to memory

// Should be (like campaigns):
broadcastRepo.QueueMessage(broadcastMsg)  // To database
```

### 2. **Missing Required Fields**
Sequences should include:
- `UserID` - For tracking who owns the message
- `SequenceID` - To link back to sequence
- `ScheduledAt` - When message was queued
- `Status` - "pending" initially

### 3. **No Message Persistence**
- If system crashes, sequence messages are lost
- No retry mechanism
- No tracking in broadcast_messages table
- No reporting/analytics

## ✅ To Make Sequences Work 100% Like Campaigns:

### 1. Add missing fields to broadcast message:
```go
broadcastMsg := domainBroadcast.BroadcastMessage{
    UserID:         job.userID,          // Need to fetch
    DeviceID:       deviceID,
    SequenceID:     &job.sequenceID,     // Add pointer
    RecipientPhone: job.phone,
    RecipientName:  job.name,
    Message:        job.messageText,
    Content:        job.messageText,
    Type:           job.messageType,
    MediaURL:       job.mediaURL.String,
    ScheduledAt:    time.Now(),          // Add
    Status:         "pending",           // Add
    MinDelay:       job.minDelaySeconds,
    MaxDelay:       job.maxDelaySeconds,
}
```

### 2. Queue to database instead of direct send:
```go
// Get broadcast repository
broadcastRepo := repository.GetBroadcastRepository()

// Queue the message (like campaigns do)
err := broadcastRepo.QueueMessage(broadcastMsg)
if err != nil {
    logrus.Errorf("Failed to queue sequence message: %v", err)
    return false
}
```

### 3. The broadcast worker will then:
- Pick up from database queue
- Process through device workers
- Update status (pending → processing → sent/failed)
- Apply anti-spam at sending layer

## 📊 Current Flow Issues:

```
CAMPAIGNS:
Create → Queue to DB → Worker picks up → Device processes → Send with anti-spam
         ✓ Persistent    ✓ Retryable     ✓ Trackable      ✓ Working

SEQUENCES:  
Create → Direct to Manager → Device processes → Send with anti-spam
         ❌ Not persistent   ❌ Not retryable  ❌ Not tracked
```

## 🎯 Summary:

Sequences are **bypassing the database queue** which campaigns use. This makes them:
- Less reliable (no persistence)
- Not trackable (no broadcast_messages records)
- Not retryable (if fails, it's gone)

To fix: Make sequences queue to database exactly like campaigns!
