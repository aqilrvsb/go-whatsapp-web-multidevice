# Sequence System Issues and Fixes

## Problems Found:

1. **Step 1 is created with wrong current_step number (4 instead of 1)**
   - The entry step (WARMEXAMA) is being saved with current_step = 4

2. **All steps are created at once but immediately processed**
   - Not respecting the 5-minute delay for Step 1
   - Not respecting the trigger times

3. **Contact names have step numbers appended**
   - "Aqil 1", "Aqil 2" instead of just "Aqil"

## Root Causes:

1. The enrollment creates all steps correctly but something is processing them out of order
2. The system is not checking `next_trigger_time <= NOW()` properly
3. Lead names might be getting modified somewhere

## Required Fixes:

1. **Enrollment should create only Step 1 as active**
   - Remove the "create all steps at once" logic
   - Go back to creating one step at a time

2. **Respect trigger times strictly**
   - Never process a step if `next_trigger_time > NOW()`
   
3. **Fix the chain reaction**
   - When Step 1 completes, create Step 2 as pending
   - Then activate Step 2 with proper trigger time

4. **Don't modify lead names**
   - Check where contact names are being appended with numbers
