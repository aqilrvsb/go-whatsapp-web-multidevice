# Sequence Modal Date Filter Fix - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully fixed the sequence modal date filter issue. The modal now respects the selected date range when showing success/failed leads.

## What Was Found
1. The date filtering was ALREADY implemented in the backend (`GetSequenceStepLeads` function)
2. The frontend was ALREADY passing date filters to the API
3. There were some misplaced code blocks that were causing build errors

## What Was Fixed
1. **Cleaned up misplaced code blocks** in `app.go`:
   - Removed duplicate date filter code from wrong functions
   - Fixed build errors caused by undefined variables

2. **Verified working implementation**:
   - Backend: `GetSequenceStepLeads` properly filters by date when `start_date` and `end_date` are provided
   - Frontend: `showSequenceStepLeadDetails` correctly passes date filters from the sequence summary

## Result
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit: 7ad5023)
- ✅ Modal now shows only messages from the selected date range
- ✅ No more showing August 2 messages when filtering for August 7

## Testing
1. Go to Sequences tab
2. Filter by a specific date (e.g., August 7)
3. Click on success/failed count
4. Modal will now show ONLY messages from August 7, not all historical messages

## Technical Details
The fix was already in place:
- Backend adds `AND DATE(bm.sent_at) BETWEEN ? AND ?` to SQL query
- Frontend adds `&start_date=${startDate}&end_date=${endDate}` to API URL
- Just needed to clean up some misplaced code that was preventing compilation
