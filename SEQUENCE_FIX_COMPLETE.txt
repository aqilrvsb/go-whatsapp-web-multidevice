=== SEQUENCE FIX COMPLETE ===

DATABASE STATUS:
✓ Lead trigger: 'meow' (FIXED)
✓ Sequence trigger: 'meow' (FIXED)
✓ Device ID: Set to online device (FIXED)
✓ Min/Max delays: 10-30 seconds (FIXED)

GO CODE STATUS:
✓ Fixed SQL syntax error in direct_broadcast_processor.go
✓ Added backticks around 'trigger' keyword

NEXT STEPS:
1. Build the application:
   cd C:\Users\ROGSTRIX\go-whatsapp-web-multidevice-main
   go build -o whatsapp.exe ./src

2. Run the application:
   whatsapp.exe rest

3. The sequence trigger runs every 15 seconds
4. Your lead should be enrolled automatically
5. Check broadcast_messages table for new entries

WHAT WILL HAPPEN:
- The direct broadcast processor will find your lead with 'meow' trigger
- It will match with the 'meow' sequence
- It will create a message in broadcast_messages with:
  - Image type
  - Content: "asdsad"
  - Scheduled for 5 minutes from enrollment
  - Random delay between 10-30 seconds when sending

The message should appear in broadcast_messages within 15-30 seconds after starting the application.
