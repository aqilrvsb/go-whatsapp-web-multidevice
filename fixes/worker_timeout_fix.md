# Fix for "timeout queueing message to worker" Error

## Issues Found:

1. **Queue Size Not Updated**: The worker queue size is still hardcoded to 1000 instead of using the config value of 10000
2. **Single Worker Per Device**: Only 1 worker per device is created, not the promised 5 workers

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Updated Queue Size (DONE)
- Changed `make(chan *domainBroadcast.BroadcastMessage, 1000)` to use `config.WorkerQueueSize` (10000)
- Applied in both:
  - `ultra_scale_broadcast_manager.go`
  - `device_worker.go`

### 2. Multiple Workers Per Device (TODO)
The current implementation only creates one worker per device in the map:
```go
bwp.workers[deviceID] = worker  // Only stores one worker
```

To implement multiple workers per device, we need to:
1. Change the worker map to store an array of workers
2. Create multiple workers (5) per device
3. Load balance messages across the workers

## Next Steps:

1. Build the application with the queue size fix
2. Deploy to Railway
3. If the issue persists, implement multiple workers per device

## Build Command:
```bash
cd C:\Users\ROGSTRIX\go-whatsapp-web-multidevice-main
build_local.bat
