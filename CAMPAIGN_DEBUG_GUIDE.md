## Campaign Issues Summary

### Issue 1: scheduled_time not saving
The frontend might be sending empty string instead of a time value. Need to:
1. Check the frontend is sending the time correctly
2. Handle empty string as NULL in backend

### Issue 2: Campaigns not showing on calendar
Possible reasons:
1. Frontend might be on wrong month (December 2024 vs June 2025)
2. API might be returning empty results due to user_id mismatch

### Quick SQL Fixes:

```sql
-- 1. Check if scheduled_time column exists with correct type
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scheduled_time TIME;

-- 2. Check your campaigns data
SELECT id, user_id, campaign_date, title, scheduled_time, status 
FROM campaigns 
ORDER BY campaign_date DESC;

-- 3. If user_id is the issue, check what user_id you're logged in as:
SELECT id, email FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@whatsapp.com';

-- 4. Update campaigns to match your user_id if needed:
-- UPDATE campaigns SET user_id = 'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE';
```

### To debug in browser:
1. Open F12 Console
2. Go to Campaign tab
3. Click "Refresh Campaigns"
4. Look for logs:
   - "Getting campaigns for user: XXX"
   - "Found campaign: ID=X, Date=XXX"
   - "Total campaigns found: X"

This will tell us if campaigns are being loaded but not displayed.
