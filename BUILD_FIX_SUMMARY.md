# Build Fixes Summary - CGO Disabled

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Compilation Errors**
- **redeclared 'once' variable**: Changed to `dcmOnce` in connection_manager.go
- **GetDevice method calls**: Updated to use `GetDeviceByID` throughout
- **Logout context parameter**: Added `context.Background()` parameter
- **Unused imports**: Removed unused config and database imports
- **UpdateDeviceStatus**: Changed from RemoveDevice to UpdateDeviceStatus

### 2. **Docker Build**
The Docker build was failing with:
```
process "/bin/sh -c CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /app/whatsapp ." did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

This is now fixed and builds successfully with CGO disabled.
