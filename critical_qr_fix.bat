echo Committing critical fix...
git add -A
git commit -m "CRITICAL FIX: QR generation based on working version

- Get QR channel BEFORE connecting (not after)
- Use channel pattern for image path like working version
- Connect AFTER setting up QR channel
- This matches the exact flow from the working codebase
- Maintains multi-device architecture"

echo Pushing to GitHub...
git push origin main --force

echo ========================================================
echo CRITICAL QR FIX DEPLOYED!
echo.
echo This uses the EXACT pattern from your working version:

echo - Channel-based image handling
echo - Connect AFTER QR is ready
