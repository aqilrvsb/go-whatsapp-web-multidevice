REM Add all changes
git add -A

REM Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix sequence device mismatch - ensure broadcast uses assigned device

FIXES:
1. Device Mismatch Issue:
   - broadcast_messages was using different device than assigned_device_id
   - Now strictly uses assigned device (no switching)
   - Messages wait if assigned device is offline

2. Enhanced Logging:
   - Added [DEVICE-SCAN] logs to show preferred device
   - Added [SEQUENCE-DEVICE] logs when creating broadcast message
   - Helps debug device assignment issues

3. Code Changes:
   - Removed selectDeviceForContact() call
   - Direct use of job.preferredDevice.String
   - No fallback to other devices

Files Changed:
- src/usecase/sequence_trigger_processor.go
