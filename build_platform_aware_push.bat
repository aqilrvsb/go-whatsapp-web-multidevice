git commit -m "fix: Platform-aware self-healing - only refresh WhatsApp devices

- Platform devices (Wablas/Whacenter) skip refresh and use external API
- Only WhatsApp devices (platform=null) go through self-healing refresh
- Uses exact same refresh logic as working UI refresh button
- Prevents unnecessary refresh attempts for platform devices
- Better error messages distinguishing platform vs WhatsApp devices"
