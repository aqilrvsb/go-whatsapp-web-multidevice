# Sequence Device Report Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The Sequence Device Report was showing incorrect totals that didn't match the Sequence Summary page.

### Problem:
- Summary page showed: 278 total contacts for "COLD Sequence"
- Device Report showed: 250 total contacts (different calculation)
- Done/Failed/Remaining counts were also inconsistent

### Root Cause:
The device report was using `COUNT(DISTINCT recipient_phone)` which gave unique contact count, while the summary page uses the formula:
```
shouldSend = doneSend + failedSend + remainingSend
```

### Fix Applied:
Updated `GetSequenceDeviceReport` function in `src/ui/rest/app.go`:

1. **Updated step statistics query** to include remaining_send count:
```go
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN bm.status IN ('pending', 'queued') THEN bm.recipient_phone END) as remaining_send
```

2. **Changed calculation logic** to match summary page:
```go
// Old: shouldSend = total (distinct count)
// New: shouldSend = doneSend + failedSend + remainingSend
```

3. **Updated overall totals query** to use same logic
4. **Added debug logging** for better troubleshooting

### Result:
Now both pages will show consistent numbers:
- Total contacts calculation uses same formula
- All status counts match between summary and device report
- Step-wise breakdowns are accurate

## Files Modified:
- `src/ui/rest/app.go` - GetSequenceDeviceReport function

## Build Command Used:
```
build_nocgo.bat
```

The fix ensures data consistency across the sequence reporting system.
