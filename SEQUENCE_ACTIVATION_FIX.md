# Sequence Activation Fix - January 20, 2025

## Problem
The sequence system was activating steps based on `current_step` number (1, 2, 3...) instead of the scheduled `next_trigger_time`. This caused steps to be processed out of order.

## Example of the Issue
```
Step 1: scheduled for 10:00 AM
Step 2: scheduled for 2:00 PM (4 hours later)  
Step 3: scheduled for 12:00 PM (2 hours after step 1)

With the bug:
- 10:00 AM: Step 1 sent → Step 2 activated (WRONG - should be Step 3)
- 2:00 PM: Step 2 sent → Step 3 activated (but it's 2 hours late!)
```

## The Fix
Changed the activation query in `updateContactProgress()` function:

### Before (WRONG):
```sql
AND current_step = (
    SELECT MIN(current_step)  -- This gets step 2, then 3, then 4...
    FROM sequence_contacts 
    WHERE status = 'pending'
)
```

### After (CORRECT):
```sql
AND next_trigger_time = (
    SELECT MIN(next_trigger_time)  -- This gets the earliest scheduled time
    FROM sequence_contacts 
    WHERE status = 'pending'
)
```

## File Changed
- `src/usecase/sequence_trigger_processor.go` - Line ~666

## Benefits
1. Steps are now activated based on their scheduled time, not step number
2. Supports flexible scheduling (e.g., Step 3 can run before Step 2 if scheduled earlier)
3. Respects the actual `trigger_delay_hours` configured for each step
4. No more out-of-order execution

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Create a sequence with non-sequential timing (e.g., Step 3 scheduled before Step 2)
2. Enroll a contact
3. Watch the logs - steps should activate based on `next_trigger_time`, not step number

## SQL to Monitor
```sql
-- See pending steps ordered by scheduled time (how they SHOULD activate)
SELECT contact_phone, current_step, next_trigger_time, status
FROM sequence_contacts
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY next_trigger_time ASC;

-- See what's currently active
SELECT contact_phone, current_step, next_trigger_time, status
FROM sequence_contacts
WHERE status = 'active';
```
