--- Fix for Device Creation Issue ---

The problem is in src/repository/user_repository.go

In the AddUserDevice function (around line 240), the SQL query has a syntax error:
WRONG:
```
INSERT INTO user_devices(id, user_id, device_name, status, last_seen, created_at)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?), last_seen
```

CORRECT:
```
INSERT INTO user_devices(id, user_id, device_name, status, last_seen, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

In the AddUserDeviceWithPhone function (around line 265), same issue:
WRONG:
```
INSERT INTO user_devices(id, user_id, device_name, phone, status, last_seen, created_at)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?), last_seen
```

CORRECT:
```
INSERT INTO user_devices(id, user_id, device_name, phone, status, last_seen, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

Also, both functions are trying to use QueryRow with Scan which is incorrect for INSERT statements.
They should use Exec instead.
