# Device Creation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When creating a new device in the Devices tab, the device appears briefly but disappears after refresh because it's not being saved to the MySQL database properly.

## Root Cause
Found SQL syntax errors in `src/repository/user_repository.go`:

1. **AddUserDevice function (line ~240):**
   - Had invalid SQL: `VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?), last_seen`
   - Was using QueryRow().Scan() for INSERT operation (wrong method)

2. **AddUserDeviceWithPhone function (line ~265):**
   - Same SQL syntax error
   - Same incorrect use of QueryRow().Scan()

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed SQL Queries:
- Removed the invalid `, last_seen` at the end
- Added `updated_at` field to match table schema
- Added default delay seconds fields

### 2. Fixed Database Operations:
- Changed from `QueryRow().Scan()` to `Exec()` for INSERT operations
- Properly initialized all required fields including:
  - `updated_at` timestamp
  - `min_delay_seconds` (default: 5)
  - `max_delay_seconds` (default: 15)

## Files Modified
- `src/repository/user_repository.go` - Fixed AddUserDevice and AddUserDeviceWithPhone functions

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   build_device_fix.bat
   ```

2. **Or manually:**
   ```bash
   go build -o whatsapp.exe src/main.go
   ```

3. **Restart the application:**
   ```bash
   whatsapp.exe rest
   ```

## Testing the Fix
1. Go to the Devices tab
2. Click "Create New Device"
3. Enter a device name
4. Click "Create"
5. Refresh the page - the device should now persist

## Additional Notes
- The device will show as "offline" initially
- To connect WhatsApp, click the "Connect" button next to the device
- The phone number will be populated after successful WhatsApp connection
