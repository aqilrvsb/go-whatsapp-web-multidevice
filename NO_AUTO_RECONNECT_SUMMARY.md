- **Status**: DISABLED - Will not start
- **Impact**: No automatic health checks every 30 seconds

### 2. **Error Monitor** ❌
- **File**: `cmd/root.go` & `error_monitor.go`
- **Status**: DISABLED - Will not monitor errors
- **Impact**: No automatic reconnection on errors

## What This Means

### ✅ **Benefits:**
1. **No Auto-Logout** - Devices won't be forcefully disconnected
2. **No Reconnection Attempts** - Failed reconnections won't mark devices offline
3. **Stable During Campaigns** - No interference during message sending
4. **Manual Control** - You decide when to reconnect devices

### ⚠️ **Trade-offs:**
1. **Devices Stay Disconnected** - If WhatsApp disconnects, device stays offline
2. **No Error Recovery** - Connection errors won't trigger reconnection
3. **Manual Monitoring Required** - You need to check device status manually

## How Devices Will Behave Now

1. **On Disconnect:**
   - Device status changes to offline
   - NO automatic reconnection attempts
   - Device stays offline until manually reconnected

2. **During Campaigns:**
   - Offline devices are skipped
   - No forced reconnection attempts
   - Campaign continues with online devices only

3. **On Errors:**
   - Errors are logged but ignored
   - No reconnection triggered
   - Device remains in current state

## To Reconnect Devices Manually

You can still manually reconnect devices using:
1. Dashboard → Device Actions → Refresh button
2. API endpoint for device refresh
3. Restart application (devices with valid sessions reconnect)

## Build Info

- **Build Date**: July 17, 2025
- **Changes**: All auto-reconnection disabled
- **Version**: Retry fix version with no auto-reconnect

The system is now in "manual mode" - devices will only reconnect when YOU decide to reconnect them!
