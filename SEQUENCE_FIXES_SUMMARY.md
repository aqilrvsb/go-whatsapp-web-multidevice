# Sequence Creation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Niche Field Not Saving**
- **Problem**: The niche field was not being saved to the database when creating sequences
- **Fix**: Added `Niche: request.Niche` to the sequence model creation in `usecase/sequence.go`
- **Also**: Updated GetSequences and GetSequenceByID to return the niche value in responses

### 2. **Time Schedule Not Saving**
- **Problem**: The time_schedule field was not being saved or displayed
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `TimeSchedule: request.TimeSchedule` to sequence creation
  - Added time schedule input field in the frontend (`sequences.html`)
  - Updated the createSequence JavaScript function to include time_schedule
  - Added display of schedule time in sequence cards

### 3. **Sequence Steps Not Saving**
- **Problem**: Steps with images and text were not being saved properly
- **Fix**:
  - Updated step creation to include all required fields:
    - `DayNumber` (was missing)
    - `ImageURL` and `MediaURL` (for image support)
    - `TimeSchedule` from the parent sequence
    - `MinDelaySeconds` and `MaxDelaySeconds`
  - Fixed the frontend to send proper step data with message_type field

### 4. **View Not Populating Fields**
- **Problem**: The sequence list view was not showing niche and time schedule
- **Fix**:
  - Updated SequenceResponse to include all fields
  - Modified the template replacement to show niche and schedule_time
  - Added steps to the response when fetching sequences

## Changes Made:

### Backend (Go):
1. **usecase/sequence.go**:
   - CreateSequence: Added niche, time_schedule, min/max delays
   - GetSequences: Returns niche, schedule_time, and steps
   - GetSequenceByID: Returns all fields including steps
   - UpdateSequence: Handles niche and time_schedule updates

### Frontend (HTML/JS):
1. **views/sequences.html**:
   - Added time schedule input field in create modal
   - Added min/max delay fields at sequence level
   - Updated createSequence function to send all fields
   - Modified step creation to include all required data
   - Updated display template to show niche and schedule time

## How to Test:

1. Build and run the application
2. Go to Sequences tab
3. Create a new sequence with:
   - Name and description
   - Niche (e.g., "Sales", "Follow-up")
   - Time schedule (e.g., "09:00")
   - Min/max delays
   - Multiple steps with text and images
4. Save and verify:
   - Niche is displayed in the card
   - Schedule time is shown
   - Steps are saved and displayed
   - All fields persist after refresh

## Database Fields Used:
- sequences.niche
- sequences.time_schedule
- sequences.min_delay_seconds
- sequences.max_delay_seconds
- sequence_steps.day_number
- sequence_steps.image_url
- sequence_steps.time_schedule
- sequence_steps.min_delay_seconds
- sequence_steps.max_delay_seconds
