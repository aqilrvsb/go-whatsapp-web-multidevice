# Platform Integration Complete Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Platform Device Support**
- Devices with `platform` column value are:
  - Skipped from status checks
  - Always treated as "online"
  - Cannot be manually refreshed/logged out
  - Always included in campaigns and sequences

### 2. **External API Integration**
- **Wablas API**: When platform = "Wablas"
  - Uses device JID as Authorization token
  - Sends text via `/api/send-message`
  - Sends images via `/api/send-image`
  
- **Whacenter API**: When platform = "Whacenter"
  - Uses device JID as device_id
  - Sends both text and images via `/api/send`

### 3. **Message Routing Logic**
```
IF device.platform IS NULL/EMPTY:
  → Send via normal WhatsApp Web
ELSE IF device.platform = "Wablas":
  → Send via Wablas API using JID as token
ELSE IF device.platform = "Whacenter":
  → Send via Whacenter API using JID as device_id
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
1. `src/pkg/external/platform_sender.go` - External API sender implementation
2. `PLATFORM_API_INTEGRATION.md` - API integration documentation
3. `PLATFORM_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation summary

### Modified Files:
1. `src/infrastructure/broadcast/whatsapp_message_sender.go` - Added platform routing
2. All campaign/sequence processors - Include platform devices as online
3. `src/repository/user_repository.go` - Show platform devices as online
4. Various other files for platform device handling

## How to Use

### 1. Set Platform for Device:
```sql
-- For Wablas
UPDATE user_devices 
SET platform = 'Wablas',
    jid = 'your-wablas-api-token'
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';

-- For Whacenter  
UPDATE user_devices
SET platform = 'Whacenter',
    jid = 'your-whacenter-device-id'
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';
```

### 2. Remove Platform (back to normal):
```sql
UPDATE user_devices 
SET platform = NULL
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';
```

## Testing
- Set platform for a device
- Create campaign/sequence targeting that device
- Check logs for "Sending message via platform Wablas/Whacenter"
- API responses are logged for debugging

## Important Notes
1. Platform devices bypass ALL status checks
2. JID column stores the API credentials (token/device_id)
3. Failed API calls mark messages as failed
4. Both campaigns and sequences use the same platform routing
