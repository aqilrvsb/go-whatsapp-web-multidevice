echo This requires checking the backend authentication flow
echo The issue is that team members are getting 401 errors on all API calls
echo This suggests the team authentication middleware is not working properly

echo Possible solutions:
echo 1. Check if admin auth middleware is blocking team requests
echo 2. Ensure team routes are registered before admin routes
echo 3. Add team session validation to shared endpoints
echo 4. Use different API prefix for team endpoints (e.g., /api/team/)
