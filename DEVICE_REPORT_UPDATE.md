# Campaign Device Report Update - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. Backend Updates (Go)

#### API Handler (`src/ui/rest/app.go`)
- Updated `GetCampaignDeviceReport` function to:
  - Call `GetCampaignBroadcastStats` to get campaign-level statistics
  - Add 4 new fields to the response:
    - `shouldSend`: Total leads matching campaign criteria (niche & target_status)
    - `doneSend`: Broadcast messages with status='sent'
    - `failedSend`: Broadcast messages with status='failed'
    - `remainingSend`: Calculated as shouldSend - doneSend - failedSend

### 2. Frontend Updates (HTML/JavaScript)

#### Dashboard HTML (`src/views/dashboard.html`)
- Updated the Campaign Device Report modal's "Overall Statistics" section:
  - **First Row** (kept existing):
    - Total Devices
    - Active Devices
    - Disconnected
    - Contacts Should Send (NEW - replaces Total Leads in first row)
  
  - **Second Row** (restructured):
    - Contacts Done Send Message (NEW)
    - Contacts Failed Send Message (NEW)
    - Contacts Remaining Send Message (NEW)
    - Total Broadcast Messages (moved from first row)

- Updated `displayDeviceReport` function to populate the new statistics
- Changed device table header from "Total Leads" to "Broadcast Messages" for clarity
- Kept other columns as "Pending", "Sent" (was "Success"), "Failed"

## Visual Changes:

### Before:
- First row: Total Devices, Active Devices, Disconnected, Total Leads
- Second row: Pending, Success, Failed

### After:
- First row: Total Devices, Active Devices, Disconnected, Contacts Should Send
- Second row: Contacts Done Send Message, Contacts Failed Send Message, Contacts Remaining Send Message, Total Broadcast Messages

## How It Works:

1. **Contacts Should Send**: 
   - Shows all leads that match the campaign's niche and target_status
   - This is the total potential audience for the campaign

2. **Contacts Done Send Message**:
   - Shows broadcast messages with status='sent'
   - This is the actual number of messages successfully sent

3. **Contacts Failed Send Message**:
   - Shows broadcast messages with status='failed'
   - This is the number of messages that failed to send

4. **Contacts Remaining Send Message**:
   - Calculated as: Should Send - Done Send - Failed Send
   - Shows how many contacts haven't been messaged yet

5. **Total Broadcast Messages**:
   - Shows the total number of broadcast message records created
   - This helps track the actual campaign execution

The device report now provides a clearer picture of:
- How many contacts SHOULD receive the message (based on criteria)
- How many HAVE received it successfully
- How many failed
- How many are still remaining

This matches the format used in both the Campaign Summary and Sequence Summary for consistency.
