   - If lead's device offline ‚Üí Sequence pauses
   - Maintains WhatsApp conversation continuity
   - No more device overload from wrong assignments

3. **Automatic Cleanup**:
   - Stuck "queued" messages ‚Üí "failed" after 5 minutes
   - Failed campaigns/sequences mark all queued as "failed"
   - No orphaned messages in database
   - Clean status tracking throughout

### ‚úÖ Device Report Improvements

   - Displays device name for each lead
   - Proper filtering by status (all/pending/success/failed)

3. **Backend Debugging**:
   - Added detailed logging for device report generation
   - Logs show campaign ID, device counts, and lead statistics
   - Helps troubleshoot any counting discrepancies

### ‚úÖ System Improvements (July 01, 2025)
1. **Sequence Progress Tracking**:
   - Added 7 new fields for progress monitoring
   - Real-time progress percentage
   - Automatic status updates
   - PostgreSQL function for atomic updates

2. **Configurable Pool Cleanup**:
   - `BROADCAST_POOL_CLEANUP_MINUTES` (default: 5)
   - `BROADCAST_MAX_WORKERS_PER_POOL` (default: 3000)
   - `BROADCAST_COMPLETION_CHECK_SECONDS` (default: 10)
   - Prevents premature cleanup of large campaigns

3. **Image Handling**:
   - Supports both URL and uploaded images (base64)
   - Automatic compression to under 350KB
   - Proper WhatsApp image message formatting

## üìä System Architecture

### Campaign Status Flow
```
pending ‚Üí triggered/failed/completed ‚Üí finished/failed
   ‚Üì          ‚Üì           ‚Üì                ‚Üì
Waiting   Processing   No Devices      Complete
         Messages      No Leads     
```

### Message Status Flow  
```
pending ‚Üí queued ‚Üí sent/failed
   ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
Created  Assigned  Delivered/Error
         to Worker
```

### Infinite Loop Prevention
1. **Campaigns**: Run once via status change + duplicate check
2. **Sequences**: Message existence check + device availability
3. **Cleanup**: Stuck messages auto-fail after 5 minutes
4. **No Retry**: Failed = Final (manual intervention required)
