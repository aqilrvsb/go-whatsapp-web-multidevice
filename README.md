**Status: ✅ Production-ready with 3000+ device support + AI Campaign + Full WhatsApp Web Interface + Team Management + Webhook API + External Platform Integration**
**Architecture: ✅ Redis-optimized + WebSocket real-time + Auto-sync + Auto-refresh + Multi-user support + External Integration + Platform APIs**
**Deploy**: ✅ Auto-deployment via Railway (Fully optimized)

## 🚀 LATEST UPDATE: Platform Device Support & External API Integration (January 15, 2025)

### ✅ NEW: Platform Device Support
Devices can now be configured to use external platforms (Wablas/Whacenter) instead of WhatsApp Web:

#### **Platform Device Features:**
- **Skip Status Checks**: Platform devices bypass all automatic status monitoring
- **Always Online**: Treated as online for campaigns and sequences
- **External API Routing**: Messages sent via Wablas or Whacenter APIs
- **No Manual Operations**: Cannot be manually refreshed or logged out

#### **How Platform Devices Work:**
1. **Normal Device** (platform = NULL): Uses WhatsApp Web as usual
2. **Wablas Device** (platform = "Wablas"): Routes messages through Wablas API
3. **Whacenter Device** (platform = "Whacenter"): Routes messages through Whacenter API

#### **Setting Up Platform Devices:**

```sql
-- Configure device for Wablas
UPDATE user_devices 
SET platform = 'Wablas',
    jid = 'your-wablas-instance-token'
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';

-- Configure device for Whacenter
UPDATE user_devices 
SET platform = 'Whacenter',
    jid = 'your-whacenter-device-id'
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';

-- Revert to normal WhatsApp Web
UPDATE user_devices 
SET platform = NULL
WHERE id = 'device-uuid';
```

#### **API Integration Details:**

**Wablas API:**
- Text endpoint: `https://my.wablas.com/api/send-message`
- Image endpoint: `https://my.wablas.com/api/send-image`
- Authorization: Uses `jid` value as Authorization header
- Format: Form-encoded data

**Whacenter API:**
- Single endpoint: `https://api.whacenter.com/api/send`
- Authentication: Uses `jid` value as device_id parameter
- Format: JSON payload

#### **Important Notes:**
- Platform devices are always included in campaigns/sequences
- JID column stores the API credentials (not WhatsApp JID)
- Failed API calls are logged and messages marked as failed
- Both text and image messages supported for all platforms

## 🚀 Previous Update: Lead Creation Webhook (January 15, 2025)

### ✅ NEW: External Lead Creation via Webhook
- **Public Endpoint**: POST `/webhook/lead/create` - No authentication required
- **WhatsApp Bot Integration**: Create leads directly from your WhatsApp bot
- **Direct Field Mapping**: Simple JSON in → Database columns out
- **Instant Response**: Returns lead_id immediately after creation
- **Perfect for Automation**: Integrate with any external service or bot

### 🔧 Webhook Quick Start:

#### 1. Endpoint URL:
```
https://web-production-b777.up.railway.app/webhook/lead/create
```

#### 2. Request Format:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "60123456789",
  "target_status": "prospect",
  "device_id": "your-device-uuid",
  "user_id": "your-user-uuid",
  "niche": "EXSTART",
  "trigger": "NEWNP"
}
```

#### 3. Testing with Postman:
- Method: `POST`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Body: Raw JSON (as above)
- No authentication needed!

#### 4. PHP Example:
```php
$url = 'https://web-production-b777.up.railway.app/webhook/lead/create';
$data = array(
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'phone' => '60123456789',
    'target_status' => 'prospect',
    'device_id' => 'your-device-uuid',
    'user_id' => 'your-user-uuid',
    'niche' => 'EXSTART',
    'trigger' => 'NEWNP'
);

$ch = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, json_encode($data));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('Content-Type: application/json'));
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
```

#### 5. Important Notes:
- **user_id** and **device_id** must be valid UUIDs from your system
- Get these IDs from your admin dashboard
- Required fields: name, phone, user_id, device_id
- Optional fields: target_status, niche, trigger

#### 6. Common Errors:
- `Invalid UUID syntax`: Ensure IDs are in format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- `401 Unauthorized`: Fixed! Webhook is now public (no auth needed)
- `400 Bad Request`: Check JSON format and required fields

## 🚀 Previous Update: Team Member Management System (January 15, 2025)

### ✅ NEW: Complete Team Member Management
- **Hierarchical Access Control**: Admin/Leader with full access, Team Members with read-only access
- **User Management Tab**: Create, edit, delete team members from admin dashboard
- **Automatic Device Assignment**: Team members automatically access devices matching their username
- **Separate Login System**: Team members login at `/team-login` with their credentials
- **Filtered Dashboard**: Team members see only their assigned devices and related data
- **No Duplicate Processing**: Background workers run only from admin account

### 🔧 How Team Management Works:
1. **Admin Creates Team Member** → Username matches device name (e.g., "Sales Team")
2. **Automatic Access** → Team member "Sales Team" sees all devices named "Sales Team"
3. **Read-Only Views** → Dashboard, Devices, Campaign Summary, Sequence Summary
4. **Real-time Updates** → When new devices are added with matching names

### 📊 Team Member Features:
- **Login**: `/team-login` - Separate authentication system

### 🛡️ Security & Architecture:
- **Separate Auth System**: Team members use different authentication from admin
- **Password Visibility**: Admin can view/reset team member passwords
- **Session Management**: 24-hour sessions with automatic cleanup
- **No Admin Access**: Team members cannot access admin functions
- **Filtered Data**: All queries automatically filtered by device ownership

## 🚀 Previous Update: Auto Device Refresh & Comprehensive Testing (January 10, 2025)

### ✅ NEW: Auto Device Refresh System
- **Automatic Recovery**: When "no device connection found" error occurs, system auto-refreshes
- **Smart Reconnection**: Attempts to reconnect using stored JID without QR scan
- **Status Guarantee**: Devices always end up as "online" or "offline" - never stuck
- **Error Monitoring**: Watches logs and triggers refresh automatically
- **Status Normalizer**: Runs every 5 minutes to ensure proper device states
- **Fixed Missing Endpoint**: Added `/api/devices/check-connection` to prevent 404 errors

### ✅ NEW: Comprehensive Testing Suite
Complete testing framework added in `/testing` directory:
1. **Test Data Generator** → Creates 3000 devices + 100k leads
2. **Worker Verification** → Check if campaigns/sequences are processing
3. **Performance Monitor** → Real-time dashboard for metrics
4. **Stress Tests** → Device churn, burst load, database stress
5. **Railway Tester** → Test live deployment directly

### 📊 How to Verify Workers Are Processing:
```bash
# 1. Check Railway logs for:
"Starting campaign broadcast worker..."
"Starting sequence processor..."
"Starting AI campaign processor..."

# 2. Run SQL to verify:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM broadcast_messages WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# 3. Visit worker status:
https://your-app.railway.app/worker/status
```

## 🎯 January 10, 2025 Updates:

### ✅ Device Status Standardization
- **Simplified Status**: Only "online" and "offline" - no more confusion
- **Auto Reconnection**: 15-minute monitor with single retry per device
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant status changes on connect/disconnect
- **Consistent Checks**: All systems use same `device.Status == "online"` logic

### ✅ System Validation Confirmed
All three systems (Campaign, AI Campaign, Sequences) properly validate:
1. **Time Schedules** ✓ Respects scheduled times with 10-minute window
2. **Device Status** ✓ Only uses online devices
3. **Min/Max Delays** ✓ Random delays between configured seconds
4. **Rate Limiting** ✓ Respects WhatsApp limits (80/hour, 800/day)

### 🔧 Key Improvements:
1. **No Retry Policy** → Messages sent once only - cleaner, faster
2. **Individual Flow Tracking** → One record per sequence step
3. **Smart Device Selection** → Load balancing with scoring algorithm
4. **15-Minute Auto Monitor** → Reconnects disconnected devices
5. **Binary Status** → Simple online/offline checks everywhere

## 🎯 Previous Update: Sequence Optimization for 3000 Devices (January 9, 2025)

### ✅ Individual Flow Tracking System
- **Flow Records**: Creates one record per sequence step for precise tracking
- **Device Attribution**: Tracks `sequence_stepid`, `processing_device_id`, and `completed_at`
- **No Retry Logic**: Single attempt only - failed messages marked immediately
- **Performance**: 100 parallel workers, 10K batch size, 10-second intervals

### 🔧 Key Optimizations:
1. **Smart Load Balancing** → Score-based device selection (70% hourly load, 30% current processing)
2. **Human-like Delays** → Random delay between min/max seconds before each message
3. **Schedule Respect** → Sequences run only during scheduled time (10-minute window)
4. **Device Protection** → Respects WhatsApp limits (80/hour, 800/day per device)
5. **Real-time Monitoring** → New views: `sequence_progress_monitor`, `device_performance_monitor`, `failed_flows_monitor`

### 📊 Performance Metrics:
- **Capacity**: 240,000 messages/hour theoretical (3000 devices × 80/hour)
- **Safe Rate**: 15,000-20,000 messages/hour distributed
- **Processing**: ~250 messages/minute with 240ms average latency
- **Workers**: 100 parallel workers for optimal throughput

## 🎯 Previous Update: Schema & Query Optimization (January 8, 2025)

### ✅ Fixed Database Schema Mismatches
- **Column Name Fixes**: Resolved `next_send_at` → `next_trigger_time` mismatch
- **Model Updates**: Updated Go models to match actual database columns
- **Query Optimization**: Simplified CTE queries to avoid column reference errors
- **Sequence Processing**: Fixed `current_day` → `current_step` throughout codebase

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:
1. **Sequence Trigger Query** → Simplified to avoid "column l.trigger does not exist" errors
2. **Removed Non-existent Columns** → Removed references to `s.priority` in ORDER BY
3. **Model Alignment** → All Go structs now match actual database schema
4. **Direct JOINs** → Replaced complex CTEs with simple JOINs for better compatibility

## 🎯 Previous Update: Complete Device Management Fix (January 7, 2025)

### ✅ All Device Management Issues Fixed
- **Real-time Updates**: Device status updates instantly via WebSocket - no refresh needed
- **Proper Logout**: Manual logout removes session from WhatsApp linked devices
- **Session Preservation**: Phone/JID preserved for easy reconnection 
- **Clean Reconnection**: Can scan QR again after any type of logout
- **Auto-reconnect**: Devices reconnect automatically after server restart

### 🔧 How It Works Now:
1. **First QR Scan** → Connects and saves phone/JID → Shows online ✅
2. **Linked Device Logout** → Updates to offline instantly, keeps phone/JID → Can rescan ✅
3. **Manual Logout Button** → Removes from WhatsApp linked devices, keeps phone/JID → Can rescan ✅
4. **Manual Refresh** → Click refresh button to reconnect devices with valid sessions ✅
5. **No Duplicate Sessions** → Proper logout prevents multiple active sessions ✅

### 🔄 Manual Device Refresh (NEW & AMAZING!):
- **Refresh Button**: Added in device dropdown menu (green refresh icon)
- **Smart Reconnection**: Uses exact JID from database to restore WhatsApp session
- **Direct Session Query**: Queries `whatsmeow_sessions` table using device JID
- **No QR Scan Needed**: If device is still linked in WhatsApp, reconnects automatically!
- **Efficient**: No more searching through all devices - direct lookup by JID
- **User Control**: You decide when to reconnect devices
- **Instant Feedback**: Shows progress and results immediately

#### How Reconnection Works:
1. **Click Refresh** → Fetches device JID from `user_devices` table
2. **Query Session** → Checks `whatsmeow_sessions` WHERE `our_jid = device.JID`
3. **Load Device** → Uses `GetDevice(ctx, jid)` for direct device retrieval
4. **Auto Connect** → If session valid, reconnects without QR scan!
5. **Fallback** → Only asks for QR if session expired or not found

#### Why This is Amazing:
- **No More Unnecessary QR Scans**: If your device is still linked in WhatsApp, it just reconnects!
- **Server Restart Friendly**: Sessions persist in PostgreSQL database
- **Direct JID Lookup**: Uses exact JID like `60146674397:74@s.whatsapp.net`
- **Preserves Multi-Device**: Maintains WhatsApp's multi-device sessions
- **Railway Compatible**: Works perfectly with PostgreSQL on Railway

SELECT session FROM whatsmeow_sessions WHERE our_jid = $1

// Get specific device by JID
waDevice, err := container.GetDevice(ctx, jid)

// Create client with existing session
client := whatsmeow.NewClient(waDevice, waLog)
client.Connect() // Reconnects without QR!
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- user_devices table stores JID
CREATE TABLE user_devices (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,
    device_name VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(50),
    jid VARCHAR(255),  -- Stores full JID like 60146674397:74@s.whatsapp.net
    status VARCHAR(50)
);

-- whatsmeow_sessions stores actual WhatsApp session
CREATE TABLE whatsmeow_sessions (
    our_jid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Device JID
    their_id TEXT,
    session BYTEA              -- Encrypted session data
);
```

### WebSocket Integration
```javascript
// Client-side WebSocket (already implemented)
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.code === 'NEW_MESSAGE') {
        loadChats(); // Auto-refresh
    }
};
```

### Server-side Notifications
```go
// Automatic notifications when message received
HandleMessageForWebView(deviceID, evt)
NotifyMessageUpdate(deviceID, chatJID, message) // WebSocket broadcast
```

### Message Flow
1. **WhatsApp Event** → `handleMessage()`
2. **Store Message** → `HandleMessageForWebView()`

## 📊 Sequence Progress Tracking & Summary

### Overview
The sequence system provides comprehensive progress tracking with real-time statistics, filtering capabilities, and detailed analytics for each sequence flow.

### Sequence Summary Page Features

#### 1. **Main Statistics Boxes (6 Total)**
- **Total Sequences**: Count of all sequences
- **Total Flows**: Sum of all flows across all sequences
- **Total Contacts Should Send**: Leads whose trigger matches sequence triggers
- **Contacts Done Send Message**: Total contacts with status='sent' 
- **Contacts Failed Send Message**: Total contacts with status='failed'
- **Contacts Remaining Send Message**: Should Send - Done Send - Failed Send

#### 2. **Detail Sequences Table**
Shows comprehensive information for each sequence:
- Name
- Niche
- Trigger
- Total Flows
- Total Contacts Should Send
- Contacts Done Send Message
- Contacts Failed Send Message
- Contacts Remaining Send Message
- Status
- Actions (View Details)

### Sequence Detail Page Features

#### 1. **Progress Overview**
Same 6 metric boxes as summary but for specific sequence:
- Total Flows
- Total Contacts Should Send
- Contacts Done Send Message
- Contacts Failed Send Message
- Contacts Remaining Send Message

#### 2. **Per-Flow Statistics**
Each flow shows:
- Should Send: Total leads for this flow
- Done Send: Successfully sent (status='sent')
- Failed Send: Failed sends (status='failed')
- Remaining: Yet to be sent

#### 3. **Date Filtering**
- Filter by date range using `completed_at` column
- Affects Done Send and Failed Send counts
- Remaining adjusts based on filtered results

### Database Schema & Logic

#### Current Implementation
```sql
-- Tables involved
leads: 
  - trigger: Comma-separated triggers (e.g., "fitness_start,welcome")
  
sequences:
  - trigger: Main sequence trigger
  - status: active/inactive
  
sequence_steps:
  - id: Unique step identifier
  - trigger: Step trigger name
  - day_number: Step sequence
  
sequence_contacts:
  - sequence_id: Link to sequence
  - sequence_stepid: Link to specific step (NEW)
  - status: sent/failed/active/pending
  - completed_at: Timestamp when processed
  - processing_device_id: Device that processed this
```

#### Calculation Logic
```sql
-- Total Should Send (matches trigger)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads 
WHERE trigger LIKE '%sequence_trigger%' AND user_id = ?

-- Done Send (per flow)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sequence_contacts 
WHERE sequence_id = ? 
  AND sequence_stepid = ? 
  AND status = 'sent'

-- Failed Send (per flow)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sequence_contacts 
WHERE sequence_id = ? 
  AND sequence_stepid = ? 
  AND status = 'failed'

-- Remaining
Should Send - Done Send - Failed Send
```

### Future Improvements (Trigger Flow System)

#### Enhanced Trigger Processing
When the sequence trigger processor runs, it will:

1. **Create Individual Records per Flow**
   ```sql
   -- When lead enters sequence, create record for EACH flow
   FOR each sequence_step:
     INSERT INTO sequence_contacts (
       sequence_id,
       sequence_stepid,      -- Links to specific flow
       contact_phone,
       status,              -- 'pending' initially
       created_at
     )
   ```

2. **Track Flow Progress**
   ```sql
   -- When flow is processed
   UPDATE sequence_contacts 
   SET 
     status = 'sent',              -- or 'failed'
     completed_at = NOW(),         -- Track when processed
     processing_device_id = ?      -- Track which device sent
   WHERE 
     sequence_id = ? 
     AND sequence_stepid = ?
     AND contact_phone = ?
   ```

3. **Benefits of This Approach**
   - **Accurate Tracking**: Each flow has its own record
   - **Device Attribution**: Know which device processed each message
   - **Timeline Analysis**: Track when each flow was sent via `completed_at`
   - **Retry Logic**: Easy to identify and retry failed flows
   - **Reporting**: Accurate per-flow statistics

#### Example Flow
```
Lead with trigger "fitness_start" enters sequence:

1. System creates 5 records (if sequence has 5 flows):
   - Flow 1: sequence_stepid = 'abc123', status = 'pending'
   - Flow 2: sequence_stepid = 'def456', status = 'pending'
   - Flow 3: sequence_stepid = 'ghi789', status = 'pending'
   - Flow 4: sequence_stepid = 'jkl012', status = 'pending'
   - Flow 5: sequence_stepid = 'mno345', status = 'pending'

2. As each flow is processed:
   - Flow 1 sent → status='sent', completed_at='2024-01-15 10:00:00'
   - Flow 2 sent → status='sent', completed_at='2024-01-16 10:00:00'
   - Flow 3 failed → status='failed', completed_at='2024-01-17 10:00:00'
   - etc.

3. Statistics show:
   - Should Send: 5 (one for each flow)
   - Done Send: 2 (flows 1 & 2)
   - Failed: 1 (flow 3)
   - Remaining: 2 (flows 4 & 5)
```

### API Endpoints

#### Sequence Summary
```
GET /api/sequences/summary

Response:
{
  "sequences": {
    "total": 2,
    "active": 1,
    "inactive": 1
  },
  "total_flows": 10,
  "total_should_send": 150,
  "total_done_send": 75,
  "total_failed_send": 5,
  "total_remaining_send": 70,
  "recent_sequences": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Welcome Sequence",
      "trigger": "welcome_new",
      "total_flows": 5,
      "should_send": 100,
      "done_send": 50,
      "failed_send": 2,
      "remaining_send": 48
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Sequence Contacts
```
GET /api/sequences/:id/contacts

Response includes all contacts with their flow assignments
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Indexing Strategy**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_sc_sequence_step ON sequence_contacts(sequence_id, sequence_stepid);
   CREATE INDEX idx_sc_status_completed ON sequence_contacts(status, completed_at);
   CREATE INDEX idx_leads_trigger ON leads(trigger);
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Use batched inserts for flow records
   - Aggregate statistics in database, not application
   - Cache sequence step data

3. **Scalability**
   - Partition sequence_contacts by date if needed
   - Archive old completed sequences
   - Use read replicas for reporting

## 🔄 Message Sequences (Trigger-Based Drip Campaigns)

### 🚀 Advanced Trigger-Based Sequence System with 3000 Device Optimization

Our sequence system uses a sophisticated **trigger-delay** architecture with **individual flow tracking** and **smart device load balancing**. Optimized for 3000+ devices with no-retry policy for maximum efficiency.

### ✅ NEW: Individual Flow Tracking System (January 9, 2025)

#### **What's New**
- **One Record Per Flow**: Each sequence step gets its own `sequence_contacts` record
- **Precise Tracking**: Know exactly which device sent which message with `sequence_stepid` and `processing_device_id`
- **No Retry**: Messages sent once only - failed messages marked immediately
- **Performance**: 100 workers, 10K batch processing, smart load balancing

#### **How It Works**
```
Lead Enrollment → Create Flow Records → Process Active Flows → Update Status → Next Flow
```

Example:
```
Lead "John" matches trigger "fitness_start"
→ System creates 30 records (one per day/flow)
→ Day 1 marked 'active', others 'pending'
→ Process Day 1 → Mark 'sent' → Activate Day 2
→ Continue until complete or failed
```

### ✅ How Trigger-Based Sequences Work

#### 1. **Trigger Flow Architecture**
```
Lead Trigger → Entry Point → Message → Delay → Next Trigger → Message → ... → Complete/Chain
```

#### 2. **Key Components**
- **Lead Trigger**: Comma-separated triggers on leads (e.g., `"fitness_start,crypto_welcome"`)
- **Step Trigger**: Unique identifier for each sequence step
- **Next Trigger**: Points to the next step or another sequence
- **Trigger Delay Hours**: Time to wait before processing next trigger (default: 24 hours)
- **Entry Point**: Marks where leads can enter the sequence
- **Auto-Generate**: Day 2+ automatically inherits triggers from previous day

#### 3. **NEW: Sequence Chaining & Auto-Trigger Updates**

##### **Automatic Trigger Generation**
- Day 1: Uses main sequence trigger (e.g., `fitness_start` → `fitness_day2`)
- Day 2-30: Auto-generates based on pattern (e.g., `fitness_day2` → `fitness_day3`)
- No manual trigger entry needed for subsequent days!

##### **Sequence Chaining**
Mark any day as "end of sequence" and chain to another:
- Check "This is the end of sequence"
- Select next sequence from dropdown
- Lead's trigger automatically updates when they complete

##### **Two Approaches for Lead Flow**

**Approach 1: Automatic Trigger Update**
When sequence ends with chaining:
```
Lead completes Day 30 → next_trigger = "advanced_fitness_start" 
→ System updates lead.trigger = "advanced_fitness_start"
→ Lead auto-enrolls in Advanced Fitness sequence
```

**Approach 2: Manual Trigger Update**
Direct lead editing:
- Edit lead → Change trigger field
- Remove old triggers, add new ones
- Lead enrolls in matching sequences on next run

#### 4. **Example Sequence Setup**
```javascript
Step 1: {
    trigger: "fitness_start",      // Entry trigger
    next_trigger: "fitness_day2",   // Next step
    trigger_delay_hours: 24,        // Wait 24 hours
    is_entry_point: true,          // Can start here
    content: "Welcome to your fitness journey!"
}

Step 2: {
    trigger: "fitness_day2",
    next_trigger: "fitness_day3", 
    trigger_delay_hours: 48,       // Wait 48 hours
    content: "Here's your workout plan..."
}

Step 3: {
    trigger: "fitness_day3",
    next_trigger: null,            // Last step - sequence ends
    trigger_delay_hours: 0,
    content: "Congratulations on completing!"
}

// OR Chain to another sequence:
Step 3: {
    trigger: "fitness_day3",
    next_trigger: "advanced_fitness_start",  // Chain to advanced sequence
    trigger_delay_hours: 24,
    content: "Ready for the next level? Starting advanced program tomorrow!"
}
```

### 🎯 Usage Example

#### 1. **Create a Sequence**
```sql
-- Sequence with trigger-based flow
Name: "30 Day Fitness Challenge"
Trigger: "fitness_start"
Niche: "fitness"

Steps:
- Day 1: trigger="fitness_start" → next="fitness_day2" (24hr delay)
- Day 2: trigger="fitness_day2" → next="fitness_day3" (24hr delay)
- Day 3: trigger="fitness_day3" → next="fitness_week1" (168hr delay)
```

#### 2. **Enroll Leads**
```javascript
// Edit lead and add trigger
Lead: {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "60123456789",
    trigger: "fitness_start"  // Automatically enters sequence
}
```

#### 3. **Processing Flow with 3000 Device Support**
```
Worker runs every 60 seconds → Checks all sequences → Processes triggers → Updates leads
```

**Detailed Flow:**
```
Hour 0: Lead gets "fitness_start" trigger
Hour 0: System sends Day 1 message via available device
Hour 24: System checks trigger_delay_hours, sends Day 2
Hour 48: System sends Day 3
...
Final Day: Either completes OR chains to next sequence
```

**Load Balancing for 3000 Devices (Optimized January 2025):**
- Worker distributes messages across all online devices
- Tracks device load (messages/hour)
- Automatic failover if device goes offline
- Respects rate limits per device
- Parallel processing for maximum throughput

### 🚀 3000 Device Optimization Updates (LATEST - January 9, 2025)

**Major Performance Improvements:**
- **Database**: 500 connections pool
- **Processing**: 100 parallel workers (was 50)
- **Batch Size**: 10,000 messages (was 5000)
- **Check Interval**: 10 seconds (was 15)
- **Throughput**: 20,000+ msg/min capability

**NEW: Individual Flow Tracking System:**
```sql
-- Each flow gets its own record
sequence_contacts:
- sequence_stepid (UUID): Links to specific step
- processing_device_id (UUID): Which device is processing
- completed_at (TIMESTAMP): When flow was completed
- status: pending → active → sent/failed
```

**Smart Device Load Balancing:**
```go
// Device selection algorithm
Score = (messages_hour * 0.7) + (current_processing * 0.3)
// Lower score = better device
// Preferred device gets priority if < 50 msgs/hour
```

**Database Optimizations:**
```sql
-- Optimized indexes for flow tracking
idx_sc_sequence_stepid    -- Flow lookups
idx_sc_processing_device  -- Device tracking
idx_sc_active_ready       -- Ready to process
idx_sc_phone_sequence     -- Contact lookups
```

**Monitoring Views:**
- `sequence_progress_monitor`: Track sequence performance
- `device_performance_monitor`: Device load and health
- `failed_flows_monitor`: Failed message analysis

**No-Retry Policy Benefits:**
- Cleaner flow: Each message attempted once only
- Better performance: No wasted cycles on failing messages
- Clear status: Immediate success/failure indication
- No duplicates: Prevents message spam from retries

**Sequence Completion Handling:**
```
IF next_trigger is empty:
    → Mark sequence as completed
    → Remove trigger from lead
    → Lead exits sequence
    
IF next_trigger is another sequence (e.g., "advanced_start"):
    → Update lead.trigger = "advanced_start"
    → Lead automatically enrolls in new sequence
    → Seamless continuation without manual intervention
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### **Platform Device Architecture**
```go
// Message routing based on platform
if device.Platform != "" {
    // Route to external API (Wablas/Whacenter)
    platformSender.SendMessage(device.Platform, device.JID, phone, message, imageURL)
} else {
    // Use normal WhatsApp Web
    whatsappClient.SendMessage(...)
}
```

#### **Platform API Integration**
- **Wablas**: Form-encoded POST with Authorization header
- **Whacenter**: JSON POST with device_id parameter
- **Credential Storage**: JID column stores API token/device_id
- **Error Handling**: API failures mark messages as failed
- **Logging**: All API responses logged for debugging

#### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Sequence steps with trigger flow
sequence_steps:
- trigger (VARCHAR): Current step identifier
- next_trigger (VARCHAR): Next step to process
- trigger_delay_hours (INT): Hours before next step
- is_entry_point (BOOLEAN): Can leads start here?

-- Lead triggers
leads:
- trigger (VARCHAR): Comma-separated active triggers

-- Contact progress tracking
sequence_contacts:
- current_trigger: Current position
- next_trigger_time: When to process next
```

#### **Processing Logic**
1. **Every 15 seconds**: Check for contacts ready to process (optimized from 30s)
2. **Find ready contacts**: `WHERE next_trigger_time <= NOW()` (up to 5000 per batch)
3. **Send messages**: Distribute across available devices with load balancing
4. **Update progress**: Set next trigger and time
5. **Complete sequence**: Remove trigger when done

### 📈 Performance Optimization (January 2025 Update)

#### **For 3000 Devices - OPTIMIZED**
- **Capacity**: 900,000+ messages/hour theoretical max
- **Safe Rate**: 15,000 messages/hour (5 msg/device/hour)
- **Processing**: Parallel across 50 workers (increased from 10)
- **Load Balancing**: Smart device assignment with sticky sessions
- **Database**: 500 connection pool + optimized indexes
- **Scaling**: Linear with device count

#### **Optimization Details**
```go
// Key Configuration Changes
const (
    DatabaseConnections = 500    // Was: 100
    WorkerCount        = 50      // Was: 10
    BatchSize          = 5000    // Was: 1000
    ProcessInterval    = 15s     // Was: 30s
    MaxPerDevice       = 80/hour // WhatsApp safe limit
)
```

#### **Database Optimizations Applied**
- Added 5 new indexes for trigger-based queries
- Removed unused timestamp columns
- Added device assignment tracking
- Optimized connection pooling

#### **Why Trigger-Based is Better**
