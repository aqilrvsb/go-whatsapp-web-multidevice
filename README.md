# WhatsApp Web Multi-Device Broadcast System

A comprehensive WhatsApp broadcast system supporting multi-device operations, campaign management, and automated messaging sequences.

## Latest Update (September 24, 2025) - Extended Time Window to 3 Hours

### ðŸ”§ Updated: Processing Time Window Extended

**Change Made**:
- Extended time window from 1 hour to 3 hours for better reliability
- Messages can now recover within 3 hours instead of 1 hour
- Prevents messages from being stuck during longer downtimes

**Code Changes**:
```sql
-- Time window (in GetPendingMessages):
AND scheduled_at >= DATE_SUB(?, INTERVAL 3 HOUR)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/repository/broadcast_repository.go` - Updated time window in GetPendingMessages() method
- Changed `INTERVAL 1 HOUR` to `INTERVAL 3 HOUR`

**Result**:
- Better recovery from extended system downtime
- More flexible message processing window
- Reduced risk of permanently stuck messages

## Previous Update (August 12, 2025) - Timezone Consistency Fix

### ðŸ”§ Fixed: Processing Timestamps & Time Window

**Problems Fixed**:
1. Messages older than 10 minutes were permanently ignored (10-minute window too short)
2. `processing_started_at` showed UTC time while system uses Malaysia time (+8)

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Extended time window from 10 minutes to 1 hour**
   - Allows recovery from short downtime
   - Prevents messages from being permanently stuck
2. **Fixed `processing_started_at` to use Malaysia time**
   - Now shows `DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 8 HOUR)` 
   - Consistent with scheduling logic and timezone

**Code Changes**:
```sql
-- Time window (in GetPendingMessagesAndLock):
AND scheduled_at >= DATE_ADD(DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR), INTERVAL 8 HOUR)

-- Processing timestamp:
processing_started_at = DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 8 HOUR)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/repository/broadcast_repository.go` - Updated `GetPendingMessagesAndLock()` method
- Changed 2 occurrences of `INTERVAL 10 MINUTE` to `INTERVAL 1 HOUR`

**Result**:
- Messages stuck due to system downtime can now recover within 1 hour
- Better balance between performance optimization and reliability
- No more permanently stuck messages

### To Fix Currently Stuck Messages:
```sql
UPDATE broadcast_messages 
SET scheduled_at = NOW()
WHERE status = 'pending'
AND scheduled_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
AND scheduled_at > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 48 HOUR)
LIMIT 500;
```

### Performance Optimization:
Add this index for faster queries (especially important with 3000+ devices):
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_broadcast_optimize 
ON broadcast_messages(status, device_id, scheduled_at);
```

## Previous Update (August 11, 2025) - Critical Race Condition Fix

### ðŸš¨ Critical Fix for Duplicate Messages

**Issue Found**: The `UltraOptimizedBroadcastProcessor` was NOT using the MySQL 5.7 compatible atomic locking, causing race conditions where multiple workers could process the same message.

### ðŸ”§ What's Fixed

1. **UltraOptimizedBroadcastProcessor Now Uses Atomic Locking**
   - Changed from simple SELECT query to `GetPendingMessagesAndLock` method
   - Each worker now atomically claims messages before processing
   - `processing_worker_id` is properly set for every message
   - No more race conditions between concurrent workers

2. **How It Works Now**
   ```go
   // Old approach (RACE CONDITION):
   SELECT * FROM broadcast_messages WHERE status = 'pending'
   
   // New approach (ATOMIC LOCKING):
   // Step 1: Atomically claim messages
   UPDATE broadcast_messages 
   SET status = 'processing', processing_worker_id = ?
   WHERE status = 'pending' AND device_id = ?
   
   // Step 2: Fetch only claimed messages
   SELECT * FROM broadcast_messages 
   WHERE processing_worker_id = ?
   ```

3. **Result**
   - Each message is processed by exactly ONE worker
   - `processing_worker_id` is now properly populated
   - No more duplicate messages sent to recipients
   - Full MySQL 5.7 compatibility maintained

### âœ… Fixed Issues
- Duplicate messages being sent to same recipient
- NULL `processing_worker_id` in database
- Race conditions in high-concurrency scenarios
- Multiple workers processing same message

## Complete System Flow (A to Z)

### **CAMPAIGN FLOW:**
1. **Trigger** â†’ `ProcessCampaigns()` runs every minute
2. **Query** â†’ Finds campaigns where `scheduled_at <= NOW()`
3. **Execute** â†’ `executeCampaign()` gets matching leads by niche/status
4. **Queue** â†’ `broadcastRepo.QueueMessage()` inserts with duplicate check
5. **Status** â†’ Campaign marked as 'triggered'

### **SEQUENCE FLOW:**
1. **Trigger** â†’ `ProcessDailySequenceMessages()` runs periodically
2. **Query** â†’ Gets active sequences and enrolled contacts
3. **Check** â†’ Verifies next step exists and no duplicate
4. **Queue** â†’ `broadcastRepo.QueueMessage()` inserts with duplicate check
5. **Progress** â†’ Updates contact to next step

### **BROADCAST PROCESSOR FLOW (WITH FIX):**
1. **Start** â†’ `UltraOptimizedBroadcastProcessor` runs every 5 seconds
2. **Get Devices** â†’ `GetDevicesWithPendingMessages()` finds devices with pending messages
3. **Lock Messages** â†’ `GetPendingMessagesAndLock()` atomically claims messages
   - Sets `status = 'processing'`
   - Sets `processing_worker_id = unique_id`
   - Sets `processing_started_at = NOW()`
4. **Check Device** â†’ Verifies device is online
5. **Create Pool** â†’ Creates broadcast pool if needed
6. **Queue to Pool** â†’ `QueueMessageToBroadcast()` adds to worker queue
7. **Update Status** â†’ Changes to 'queued'

### **WORKER PROCESSING:**
1. **Worker Gets Message** â†’ From internal queue
2. **Safety Check** â†’ Verifies not already sent
3. **Rate Limit** â†’ Waits for send permission (5-15 seconds)
4. **Send** â†’ `sendWhatsAppMessage()` sends via WhatsApp
5. **Update Status**:
   - **Success** â†’ `UPDATE status = 'sent', sent_at = NOW()`
   - **Failed** â†’ `UPDATE status = 'failed', error_message = ?`

### **Message Status Flow:**
```
pending â†’ processing â†’ queued â†’ sent/failed
```

### **Duplicate Prevention Layers:**
1. **Application Level** â†’ QueueMessage checks before insert
2. **Database Level** â†’ Atomic locking with processing_worker_id
3. **Worker Level** â†’ Safety check before sending

## Previous Update (August 10, 2025) - MySQL 5.7 Compatibility Fix

### ðŸš€ Critical Fix for Duplicate Messages

**Root Cause Found**: The system was using `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` which is **not supported in MySQL 5.7**. This caused the atomic locking to fail completely, resulting in multiple workers sending the same message.

### ðŸ”§ What's Fixed

1. **MySQL 5.7 Compatible Atomic Locking**
   - Changed from `SELECT...FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to `UPDATE-then-SELECT` pattern
   - Now uses atomic UPDATE to claim messages before selecting them
   - 100% compatible with MySQL 5.7 and newer versions

2. **How It Works Now**
   ```sql
   -- Step 1: Atomically claim messages
   UPDATE broadcast_messages 
   SET status = 'processing', processing_worker_id = ?
   WHERE status = 'pending' AND device_id = ?
   LIMIT ?
   
   -- Step 2: Fetch claimed messages
   SELECT * FROM broadcast_messages 
   WHERE processing_worker_id = ?
   ```

3. **Result**
   - Each message is processed by exactly ONE worker
   - No race conditions possible
   - `processing_worker_id` is properly set for audit trail
   - Zero duplicate messages guaranteed

### âœ… Fixed Issues
- Multiple workers no longer send the same message
- `processing_worker_id` is now properly populated
- Works perfectly with MySQL 5.7, 8.0, and MariaDB

## System Architecture

### Message Flow

#### Sequences (A to Z):
1. **Creation**: Admin creates sequence with multiple day steps
2. **Enrollment**: Leads enrolled based on triggers (e.g., COLDVITAC)
3. **Daily Processing**: `ProcessDailySequenceMessages` creates messages for each contact's current day
4. **Duplicate Check**: Verifies no existing message for step+phone+device
5. **Queue**: Message added to `broadcast_messages` table
6. **Processing**: Worker claims message with atomic UPDATE
7. **Sending**: WhatsApp API sends message
8. **Status Update**: Marked as 'sent'

#### Campaigns (A to Z):
1. **Creation**: Admin creates campaign with target criteria
2. **Triggering**: `ProcessCampaignTriggers` runs every minute
3. **Lead Matching**: Finds leads matching campaign criteria
4. **Duplicate Check**: Verifies no existing message for campaign+phone+device
5. **Queue**: Message added to `broadcast_messages` table
6. **Processing**: Same as sequences - atomic worker claiming
7. **Sending**: Same as sequences

### Duplicate Prevention (3 Layers)

1. **Application Level**
   - Pre-insert checks in `QueueMessage()`
   - Comprehensive status checking (pending, processing, queued, sent)

2. **Worker Level**
   - **UPDATE-then-SELECT** ensures true atomic locking (MySQL 5.7 compatible)
   - Each worker exclusively claims messages before processing
   - No race conditions possible between concurrent workers
   - `processing_worker_id` tracks which worker owns each message

3. **Database Level**
   - Unique constraints (run `add_unique_constraints.sql`)
   - Prevents duplicates even if application logic fails

### Technical Implementation Details

The `GetPendingMessagesAndLock` method now uses MySQL 5.7 compatible atomic locking:
- **UPDATE**: Claims messages by setting status and worker ID atomically
- **SELECT**: Fetches only the messages claimed by this specific worker
- **Result**: Perfect concurrency with zero duplicates

This allows 3000+ devices to process messages simultaneously without conflicts.

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
- `broadcast_messages`: Central message queue
- `campaigns`: Campaign definitions
- `sequences`: Sequence definitions
- `sequence_steps`: Individual sequence messages
- `sequence_contacts`: Enrolled contacts
- `leads`: Contact database

### Important Columns in broadcast_messages
- `processing_worker_id`: Atomic lock for message claiming
- `processing_started_at`: Timestamp for stuck message detection
- `sequence_stepid`: For sequence duplicate prevention
- `campaign_id`: For campaign duplicate prevention
- `device_id`: Device that will send the message
- `recipient_phone`: Target contact

## Configuration

### Required Database Changes
Run `add_unique_constraints.sql` to add:
```sql
-- Sequence unique constraint
ALTER TABLE broadcast_messages 
ADD UNIQUE INDEX unique_sequence_message (
    sequence_stepid, 
    recipient_phone, 
    device_id
);

-- Campaign unique constraint  
ALTER TABLE broadcast_messages 
ADD UNIQUE INDEX unique_campaign_message (
    campaign_id, 
    recipient_phone, 
    device_id
);
```

## Monitoring

### Check Worker ID Usage
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as total,
    COUNT(processing_worker_id) as with_worker_id,
    ROUND(COUNT(processing_worker_id) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as percentage
FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Check for Duplicates
```sql
-- Sequence duplicates
SELECT sequence_stepid, recipient_phone, device_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE sequence_stepid IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sequence_stepid, recipient_phone, device_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Campaign duplicates
SELECT campaign_id, recipient_phone, device_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE campaign_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY campaign_id, recipient_phone, device_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Check Stuck Messages
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as stuck_count
FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE status = 'processing'
AND processing_started_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 5 MINUTE);
```
