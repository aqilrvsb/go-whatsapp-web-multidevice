## 📊 System Architecture

### Campaign Status Flow
```
pending → triggered → processing → finished/failed
   ↓          ↓           ↓             ↓
Waiting   Creating    Sending      Complete
         Messages               
```

### Message Processing Pipeline
```
1. Campaign Trigger (every minute)
   → Finds pending campaigns
   → Creates broadcast_messages
   
2. Broadcast Processor (every 2 seconds)  
   → Groups by campaign/sequence
   → Creates worker pools
   
3. Worker Pools (1 per broadcast)
   → Up to 3000 workers per pool
   → Sends via WhatsApp
   → Updates status
```

## 🎯 System Rating: 9.5/10 ⭐

```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
# Backup before changes
backup_working_version.bat

# Run migrations (automatic on startup)
```

### 2. Configure Devices

- Set human-like delays (10-30 seconds)
- Schedule or send immediately

### 4. Monitor Progress
- Campaign Summary shows complete status flow
- Worker Status shows real-time activity
- Sequence Summary shows progress percentage
