=========================================

UI SUMMARY DATA:
- Total Sequences: 7
- Total Flows: 23
- Total Contacts Should Send: 1389
- Contacts Done Send: 918
- Contacts Failed Send: 471
- Contacts Remaining: 0

DATABASE SUMMARY DATA (by scheduled_at):
- Total Sequences: 7
- Total Flows (sequence_steps): 25
- Total Unique Contacts: 1224
- Total Messages Sent: 1632 (910 unique contacts)
- Total Messages Failed: 715 (471 unique contacts)
- Messages Remaining: 0

UI INDIVIDUAL SEQUENCES:
1. meow: Should=0, Sent=0, Failed=0
2. HOT VITAC SEQUENCE: Should=302, Sent=222, Failed=80
3. WARM VITAC SEQUENCE: Should=202, Sent=162, Failed=40
4. COLD VITAC SEQUENCE: Should=362, Sent=267, Failed=95
5. HOT Seqeunce: Should=152, Sent=71, Failed=81
6. WARM Sequence: Should=224, Sent=97, Failed=127
7. COLD Sequence: Should=147, Sent=99, Failed=48

TOTALS FROM UI ROWS: Should=1389, Sent=918, Failed=471

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Total Sequences match: UI=7, DB=7 ✓
2. Total Flows differ: UI=23, DB=25 (2 difference)
3. Failed contacts match exactly: UI=471, DB=471 ✓
4. Sent contacts close: UI=918, DB=910 unique (8 difference)
5. The UI shows unique contacts, not total messages
6. Database shows 1632 total sent messages but only 910 unique recipients

DISCREPANCIES:
- Flows count: UI shows 23 but DB has 25 sequence_steps
- Sent count: UI shows 918 but DB shows 910 unique contacts sent
- Should Send: UI shows 1389 but DB shows 1224 unique contacts

The data is mostly aligned with minor discrepancies that could be due to:
1. Timing differences in data capture
2. Some contacts receiving multiple messages (sequence steps)
3. Possible data updates between UI snapshot and database query
