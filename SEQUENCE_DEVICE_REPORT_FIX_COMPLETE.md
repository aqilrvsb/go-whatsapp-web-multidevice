# SEQUENCE DEVICE REPORT FIX SUMMARY

## Changes Made (Already Built into whatsapp.exe)

### 1. Backend Fixes (src/ui/rest/app.go)
- Fixed `GetSequenceDeviceReport` to use string UUIDs instead of integers
- Changed query from non-existent `step_order` column to `COALESCE(day_number, day, 1)`
- Added detailed error logging throughout the function
- Fixed all sequence-related functions to handle UUID strings properly

### 2. Frontend Fixes (src/views/dashboard.html)
- Added dynamic step statistics display section
- Shows aggregated counts per step across all devices
- Each step displays as a card with:
  - Should send count
  - Done send count
  - Failed send count
  - Remaining send count
  - Success rate progress bar
- Hide step statistics section for regular campaigns

### 3. Fixed SQL Query
```sql
SELECT id, 
       COALESCE(day_number, day, 1) as step_order, 
       message_type, 
       content, 
       COALESCE(day_number, day, 1) as day_num
FROM sequence_steps
WHERE sequence_id = ?
ORDER BY COALESCE(day_number, day, 1)
```
