# Campaign Summary and Sequence Summary Issues Analysis

## Current Status

### Campaign Summary Issues:
1. **API Endpoint**: `/api/campaigns/summary` ✓ Working
2. **Handler**: `GetCampaignSummary` in `app.go` ✓ Correct
3. **MySQL Queries**: ✓ Properly converted from PostgreSQL
4. **Problem**: No broadcast messages in database
   - The `broadcast_messages` table is empty
   - Campaigns show correct "should send" count but 0 for actual sent

### Sequence Summary Issues:
1. **API Endpoint**: `/api/sequences/summary` ✓ Working
2. **Handler**: `GetSequenceSummary` in `app.go` ✓ Correct
3. **MySQL Queries**: ✓ UUID casting already removed
4. **Problem**: No sequence broadcast messages
   - Sequences exist but no broadcast messages created
   - Sequence contacts exist but not triggering messages

## Root Cause Analysis

The summaries are not showing data because:
1. **Broadcast messages are not being created** when campaigns/sequences are triggered
2. The counting queries are correct but there's no data to count

## Required Fixes

### 1. Check Campaign Trigger Logic
- Need to verify campaigns are creating broadcast messages when triggered
- Check if the worker process is running to process campaigns

### 2. Check Sequence Processing Logic
- Verify sequences are creating broadcast messages for each step
- Check if sequence contacts are being processed

### 3. Verify Worker Status
- The broadcast worker should be running to process messages
- Check `/api/workers/status` endpoint

## Quick Test

To verify the APIs are working, you can manually insert test data:

```sql
-- Insert a test broadcast message for campaign 56
INSERT INTO broadcast_messages (
    id, user_id, device_id, campaign_id, 
    recipient_phone, message_type, content, 
    status, created_at
) VALUES (
    UUID(), 
    (SELECT user_id FROM campaigns WHERE id = 56),
    (SELECT device_id FROM campaigns WHERE id = 56),
    56,
    '60123456789',
    'text',
    'Test message',
    'success',
    NOW()
);
```

Then check if the campaign summary updates.

## Recommendations

1. **Check if broadcast workers are running**
2. **Verify campaign trigger process creates broadcast messages**
3. **Check sequence processing creates broadcast messages**
4. **Monitor the broadcast_messages table when triggering campaigns**
