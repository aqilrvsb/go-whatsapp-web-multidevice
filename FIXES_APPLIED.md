# WhatsApp Multi-Device Fixes Summary

## Date: June 27, 2025

### 1. Fixed Delete Device Issue
**Problem**: "interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not string" error when deleting device
**Solution**: 
- Updated `GetDevice` function in `user_repository.go` to use COALESCE for NULL phone/jid values
- Added new `GetDeviceByID` function that doesn't require userID
- Updated `DeleteDevice` handler to use the new function

### 2. Fixed Campaign Database Constraint
**Problem**: Only one campaign allowed per date due to UNIQUE constraint
**Solution**:
- Removed UNIQUE constraint from campaigns table in `connection.go`
- Updated `CreateCampaign` function to remove ON CONFLICT clause
- Created migration file `004_remove_campaign_constraint.sql`
- Updated campaign display logic to support multiple campaigns per date

### 3. Enhanced Campaign Display (copied from whatsapp-mcp-main)
**Changes**:
- Updated `loadCampaigns` to group campaigns by date into arrays
- Enhanced campaign display with status colors and badges
- Added support for showing up to 5 campaigns per day with "+X more" indicator
- Added campaign status indicators (completed, failed, ongoing, scheduled)
- Added CSS styles for campaign items and badges

### 4. Enhanced Dashboard Device Detection (copied from whatsapp-mcp-main)
**Changes**:
- Updated `updateDeviceFilter` to automatically select the latest device
- Device selection based on created_at timestamp
- If no device selected, automatically selects the most recent one
- Improved device filter dropdown functionality

### 5. QR Code Scanning Issue
**Status**: This appears to be a timeout or connection tracking issue
**Recommendation**: 
- Check WhatsApp client initialization timeout settings
- Verify WebSocket connection for real-time QR updates
- Consider implementing polling mechanism like in whatsapp-mcp-main

## Files Modified:
1. `src/repository/user_repository.go` - Fixed NULL handling in GetDevice
2. `src/ui/rest/app.go` - Updated DeleteDevice handler
3. `src/views/dashboard.html` - Updated campaign display and device filter
4. `src/repository/campaign_repository.go` - Removed ON CONFLICT
5. `src/database/connection.go` - Removed UNIQUE constraint
6. `database/migrations/004_remove_campaign_constraint.sql` - New migration

## Database Migration Required:
Run this SQL to fix existing databases:
```sql
ALTER TABLE campaigns DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS campaigns_user_id_campaign_date_key;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_campaigns_user_date ON campaigns(user_id, campaign_date);
```

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Delete device functionality works without errors
- [ ] Multiple campaigns can be created for the same date
- [ ] Campaign calendar shows all campaigns with proper styling
- [ ] Dashboard automatically selects latest device
- [ ] Device filter properly filters analytics data
