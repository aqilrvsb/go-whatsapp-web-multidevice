# WhatsApp Multi-Device System - Timezone Fix Summary

## Date: June 28, 2025

## Problem Summary
The campaign and sequence scheduling system had timezone issues where:
- Server was running in UTC (June 27, 23:00)
- User was in Malaysia timezone UTC+8 (June 28, 07:00)
- Campaigns scheduled for June 28 wouldn't trigger because server thought it was still June 27
- Date parsing errors due to mixed date/time formats in database

## Changes Made

### 1. **Campaign Trigger Optimization**
- Simplified campaign trigger to use `GetPendingCampaigns()` from repository
- Removed complex timezone calculations from application code
- Let PostgreSQL handle timezone conversions using `AT TIME ZONE`

### 2. **Repository Updates**
- Updated `GetPendingCampaigns()` to use PostgreSQL timezone functions
- Query now checks if campaign time has passed using:
  ```sql
  (campaign_date || ' ' || scheduled_time)::timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Kuala_Lumpur' <= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  ```
- Handles NULL/empty scheduled_time as "run immediately"

### 3. **Database Migrations**
Created two migration scripts:
- `001_add_timestamptz_to_campaigns.sql` - Adds TIMESTAMPTZ columns
- `002_comprehensive_timezone_migration.sql` - Complete migration with indexes and views

### 4. **Sequence Processing**
- Added daily sequence message processing
- Checks if 24 hours have passed since last message
- Automatically progresses contacts through sequence steps
- Logs all sequence activities

### 5. **User Isolation Fixes**
- All worker status endpoints now filter by user ID
- Device ownership validation added
- Campaigns only use devices owned by the campaign creator

## Key Benefits

1. **Timezone Agnostic**: Server can be in any timezone, campaigns work correctly
2. **PostgreSQL Optimized**: Database handles all timezone conversions
3. **Simpler Code**: Removed complex timezone math from Go code
4. **Better Performance**: Added indexes for scheduled_at queries
5. **Future Proof**: Handles DST changes automatically

## How Campaigns Work Now

1. User creates campaign with date/time in their local timezone
2. Campaign is stored with status = 'pending'
3. Every minute, trigger checks for campaigns where:
   - Status is 'pending'
   - Scheduled time (in Malaysia timezone) <= current time
4. Matching campaigns are executed immediately
5. Messages are distributed across user's connected devices
6. Campaign status updated to 'sent'

## How Sequences Work Now

1. New leads matching sequence niche are auto-enrolled
2. Every minute, system checks for contacts needing their next message
3. If 24 hours have passed since last message, next step is sent
4. Contact progresses through sequence automatically
5. Sequence completes when all steps are sent

## Testing Your Campaign

To make your pending campaign trigger immediately:

```sql
-- Option 1: Set to past time
UPDATE campaigns 
SET scheduled_time = NULL,
    status = 'pending'
WHERE title = 'amasd';

-- Option 2: Check campaign status
SELECT * FROM campaign_status_view WHERE status = 'pending';
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Run the migration script in PostgreSQL
3. Your campaigns will start working with proper timezone handling

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Sends date/time as user sees it
- **Backend**: Stores in database, lets PostgreSQL handle timezone
- **Trigger**: Uses PostgreSQL's timezone-aware comparisons
- **Result**: Works correctly regardless of server timezone
