# Sequences UI Updates - Phase 2

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Fixed Image Reset Issue**
- When opening a day modal, the file input is now properly reset
- Each day's image is stored separately and doesn't carry over
- Clear separation between different days' content

### 2. **View Button Now Opens Editable Sequence**
- Clicking "View" button now opens the sequence in edit mode
- Shows the same calendar interface as create mode
- All days are populated with existing data
- Can edit any day by clicking on it
- Update button saves changes via PUT request

### 3. **Sequence Summary Tab Shows Details**
- Changed from statistics view to full sequences table
- Shows all sequences with:
  - Name, Description, Tag
  - Number of days configured
  - Number of contacts enrolled
  - Current status
  - Action buttons

### 4. **New Preview Feature in Summary Tab**
- "Preview" button shows all sequence messages in a modal
- Displays timeline of all days with:
  - Formatted message content (bold, italic, etc.)
  - Images if attached
  - Delay settings
- Can jump to edit mode from preview

## How It Works Now

### Sequences Tab
1. **Create Sequence**: Opens calendar modal for new sequence
2. **View Button**: Opens sequence in editable calendar mode
3. **Delete Button**: Removes sequence with confirmation
4. **Toggle Switch**: Activates/deactivates sequence

### Sequence Summary Tab
1. Shows table of all sequences
2. **Preview Button**: Shows timeline of all messages
3. **Edit Button**: Opens sequence in calendar edit mode
4. Direct link from preview to edit

### Edit Mode Features
- Populates all existing days
- Can modify any day's content
- Add/remove days as needed
- Update global settings (delays, time)
- Save updates with "Update Sequence" button

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added/Modified:
1. `viewEditSequence(sequenceId)` - Loads sequence data and opens in edit mode
2. `updateSequence(sequenceId)` - Saves changes via PUT request
3. `loadSequenceSummary()` - Now loads full sequences list
4. `displaySequenceSummary(sequences)` - Shows table with actions
5. `previewSequenceMessages(sequenceId)` - Shows message timeline
6. `showSequencePreviewModal(sequence)` - Renders preview modal

### Modal Behavior:
- Resets to create mode when closed
- Properly cleans up edit state
- File inputs reset between days
- Dynamic title/button text for create vs edit

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Sequence details moved to appropriate Summary tab
2. **Inline Editing**: No need for separate edit page
3. **Quick Preview**: See all messages at a glance
4. **Consistent UI**: Same calendar interface for create and edit
5. **Improved Workflow**: Preview â†’ Edit flow is seamless

## Testing

1. Create a sequence with multiple days
2. Click View - should open in edit mode with all data
3. Modify some days and save
4. Go to Sequence Summary tab
5. Click Preview - see all messages
6. Click Edit from preview - opens in calendar mode
7. Image uploads should reset between different days
