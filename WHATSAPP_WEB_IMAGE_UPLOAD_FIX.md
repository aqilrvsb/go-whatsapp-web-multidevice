# WhatsApp Web Image Upload Fix - Second Attempt

## Issue Description
After sending the first image successfully, the second image upload doesn't show the preview modal. The file selection dialog opens, but after selecting an image, nothing happens.

## Root Cause
The file input element wasn't being reset properly. When you select the same file twice, the 'change' event doesn't fire because the value hasn't changed.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Reset file input value** in `selectImage()` function:
   ```javascript
   // Reset the file input value to ensure change event fires even for same file
   const imageInput = document.getElementById('imageUpload');
   imageInput.value = '';
   imageInput.click();
   ```

2. **Fixed syntax errors**:
   - Added missing parentheses to `setupImageInput()` call
   - Fixed `let isSendingImage = false;` declaration

3. **Added debug logging** to help diagnose future issues

## Testing Steps
1. Open WhatsApp Web interface
2. Select a chat
3. Click paperclip icon and select an image
4. Send the image with or without caption
5. Click paperclip icon again and select another image (or same image)
6. The preview modal should now appear correctly
