# WhatsApp Web Issues Fixed

## Date: January 2025

### Issue 1: Sent Images Not Displaying (404 Error)

**Problem:** When sending images through WhatsApp Web, the images were not viewable after sending. The browser console showed 404 errors like:
```
3EB0833A76CAC6FD56FEC9.jpg:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
```

**Root Cause:** The code was creating a media URL like `/media/{messageID}.jpg` but wasn't actually saving the image file to disk with that name.

**Fix Applied:** Modified `whatsapp_web_send.go` to:
1. Save the sent image to disk with the message ID as filename
2. Store the correct media URL in the database
3. Added proper error handling for file write operations

**Code Changes:**
```go
// Save the image to disk first
filename := fmt.Sprintf("%s.jpg", resp.ID)
imagePath := filepath.Join(config.PathStorages, filename)
err = os.WriteFile(imagePath, imageData, 0644)
if err != nil {
    logrus.Errorf("Failed to save sent image: %v", err)
}

mediaURL := "/media/" + filename
```

### Issue 2: Refresh Icon and Loading Messages

**Problem:** The WhatsApp Web interface had a refresh icon and showed loading messages that interrupted the user experience.

**Fix Applied:** 
1. Removed the refresh button from the header
2. Removed loading spinners from chat and message loading functions
3. The interface now updates seamlessly in the background using WebSocket

**UI Changes:**
- Removed refresh button (`bi-arrow-clockwise` icon)
- Removed "Loading chats..." spinner
- Removed "Loading messages..." spinner
- Chats and messages now load without visual interruption

## Testing Instructions

1. Build the application using `build_local.bat`
2. Run the application
3. Navigate to WhatsApp Web interface
4. Test sending images - they should now display correctly after sending
5. Notice the interface no longer shows loading spinners or refresh buttons

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `src/ui/rest/whatsapp_web_send.go` - Fixed image saving logic
2. `src/views/whatsapp_web.html` - Removed refresh UI elements

### New Dependencies Added:
- `os` - For file operations
- `path/filepath` - For path handling
- `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` - For logging errors
- `github.com/aldinokemal/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice/config` - For storage path

## Result

✅ Sent images are now properly saved and displayed
✅ Clean UI without unnecessary refresh indicators
✅ Seamless real-time updates via WebSocket
