git commit -m "feat: Implement self-healing worker architecture for 3000+ devices

- Added WorkerClientManager with GetOrRefreshClient() for automatic connection refresh
- Workers now refresh device connections before each message send
- Disabled background keepalive and health monitor systems
- No more 'device not found' errors - guaranteed fresh connections
- Scales efficiently to 3000+ devices without background overhead
- Per-device mutex prevents duplicate refreshes
- Updated README with self-healing architecture documentation"

echo Pushing to GitHub...
