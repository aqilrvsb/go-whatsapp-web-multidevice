# SEQUENCE ONE-BY-ONE IMPLEMENTATION - January 19, 2025

## New Approach:
Instead of creating all 4 steps at enrollment, we now create steps one at a time:

### 1. **On Enrollment**:
- Only creates Step 1 (status='active', next_trigger_time=NOW)
- No other steps are created yet

### 2. **When Step 1 Completes**:
- Marks Step 1 as 'completed'
- Creates Step 2 with:
  - status = 'active'
  - next_trigger_time = NOW + trigger_delay_hours (e.g., 12 hours)
  - current_step = actual day_number from sequence_steps (supports 1,3,6,9...)

### 3. **When Step 2 Completes**:
- Marks Step 2 as 'completed'
- Creates Step 3 with proper delay
- And so on...

### 4. **When Last Step Completes**:
- Marks it as 'completed'
- Removes trigger from lead
- No more steps created

## Benefits:
1. **No Multiple Active Steps**: Only ONE record exists per contact at any time
2. **Accurate Timing**: next_trigger_time is calculated from actual completion time
3. **Dynamic Steps**: Supports non-sequential day numbers (1,3,6,9...)
4. **Clean Data**: No pending records cluttering the database

## How It Works:

### Enrollment:
```sql
-- Only creates one record per contact
INSERT INTO sequence_contacts (step 1 details...)
```

### After Each Step:
```sql
-- Mark current as completed
UPDATE sequence_contacts SET status='completed' WHERE id=X

-- Create next step (if exists)
INSERT INTO sequence_contacts (next step details...)
```

### Processing:
```sql
-- Still the same query
SELECT * FROM sequence_contacts 
WHERE status='active' 
AND next_trigger_time <= NOW()
```

## Key Changes:
1. `enrollContactInSequence` - Only creates first step
2. `updateContactProgress` - Creates next step instead of updating existing
3. Uses actual `day_number` from sequence_steps (not incrementing)
4. Properly handles sequence completion (no next_trigger)

## Result:
- Clean, simple, one record per contact
- Impossible to have multiple active steps
- Timing based on actual completion, not enrollment
- Supports any step numbering scheme
