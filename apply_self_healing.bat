REM Script to complete the self-healing device connection implementation

echo 🔄 Applying self-healing device connection fixes...

REM 1. Create backup of original files
echo 1. Creating backups...
copy "src\cmd\rest.go" "src\cmd\rest.go.backup" >nul 2>&1
copy "src\infrastructure\whatsapp\client_manager.go" "src\infrastructure\whatsapp\client_manager.go.backup" >nul 2>&1

echo 2. Manual changes needed in cmd\rest.go:
echo    - Comment out healthMonitor lines around line 137-140
echo    - Add: logrus.Info("🔄 SELF-HEALING MODE: Workers refresh clients per message")

echo 3. Manual changes needed in client_manager.go:
echo    - Remove km := GetKeepaliveManager() calls
echo    - Remove km.StartKeepalive() and km.StopKeepalive() calls

echo.
echo ✅ Self-healing files created!
echo.
echo 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
echo ✅ WorkerClientManager created (worker_client_manager.go)
echo ✅ WhatsAppMessageSender updated (whatsapp_message_sender.go)  
echo ⚠️  Manual edits needed in cmd\rest.go and client_manager.go
echo.
echo 📊 EXPECTED BENEFITS:
echo - No more "device not found" errors
echo - Auto-refresh per message send
echo - Supports 3000+ devices simultaneously
echo - No background keepalive overhead
echo.
echo 🔨 NEXT STEPS:
echo 1. Make manual edits to disable background systems
echo 2. Build: go build -o whatsapp.exe  
echo 3. Test with small campaign
echo 4. Monitor logs for refresh messages
echo.
echo 🔍 SUCCESS INDICATORS:
echo - Log: "🔄 SELF-HEALING MODE: Workers refresh clients per message"
echo - Log: "🔄 Refreshing device X for worker message sending..."
echo - Log: "✅ Successfully refreshed device X"
echo - No "device not found" errors in campaigns
