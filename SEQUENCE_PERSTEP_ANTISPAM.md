# Sequence Anti-Spam Implementation - Per Step Delays

## âœ… Changes Applied

The sequence processor now uses delays from `sequence_steps` table (not `sequences` table), allowing different delays for each step in the sequence.

### Query Updated:
```sql
-- Before: Used sequence-level delays
COALESCE(s.min_delay_seconds, 5) as min_delay_seconds,
COALESCE(s.max_delay_seconds, 15) as max_delay_seconds

-- After: Uses step-level delays  
COALESCE(ss.min_delay_seconds, 5) as min_delay_seconds,
COALESCE(ss.max_delay_seconds, 15) as max_delay_seconds
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now:

1. **Per-Step Delays**: Each sequence step can have different delays
   - Step 1: 5-10 seconds (fast for welcome)
   - Step 2: 10-30 seconds (slower for content)
   - Step 3: 15-45 seconds (even slower)

2. **Contact Name**: Fetched from `sequence_contacts.contact_name`

3. **Anti-Spam Applied**: Same as campaigns
   - Malaysian greetings
   - Message randomization  
   - Human-like delays

## ðŸ“Š Example Configuration:

```sql
-- Set different delays for each step
UPDATE sequence_steps SET 
    min_delay_seconds = 5,
    max_delay_seconds = 10
WHERE sequence_id = 'seq-123' AND day_number = 1;

UPDATE sequence_steps SET 
    min_delay_seconds = 15,
    max_delay_seconds = 30  
WHERE sequence_id = 'seq-123' AND day_number = 2;

UPDATE sequence_steps SET 
    min_delay_seconds = 20,
    max_delay_seconds = 40
WHERE sequence_id = 'seq-123' AND day_number = 3;
```

## ðŸ”„ Message Flow:

```
Sequence Step (with delays) 
    â†’ Sequence Contact (with name)
    â†’ Broadcast Message (with anti-spam data)
    â†’ WhatsApp Sender (applies greeting + randomization)
    â†’ Recipient receives unique message
```

No database migrations needed - just using existing columns!
