// Fix for WhatsApp "Logging In" Loop Issue

The problem occurs because after successful QR pairing:
1. WhatsApp recognizes the QR and starts pairing
2. The PairSuccess event is fired
3. But the connection isn't fully established
4. Device status remains "offline" in database

SOLUTION:

1. After PairSuccess event, we need to:
   - Update device status to "connecting" 
   - Wait for Connected event
   - Update device status to "online"
   - Save the JID (WhatsApp ID) to database

2. The handlePairSuccess function needs to:
   - Get the current device from database
   - Update its status and JID
   - Broadcast the success to frontend

3. Frontend needs to:
   - Listen for LOGIN_SUCCESS message
   - Reload devices to show updated status
   - Close the QR modal

IMMEDIATE WORKAROUND:

Since the QR pairing is partially working, try:

1. After scanning QR and seeing "Logging in...":
   - Wait 30-60 seconds
   - Refresh the browser page
   - Check if device shows as connected

2. If still not working:
   - Clear WhatsApp Web data on your phone:
     Settings > Storage > WhatsApp > Clear data (for Web sessions only)
   - Try Phone Code method instead

3. Check server logs for any errors during pairing

The core issue is that the WhatsApp client needs proper event handling for the full connection flow:
QR Scan -> PairSuccess -> Connecting -> Connected -> Update Database
