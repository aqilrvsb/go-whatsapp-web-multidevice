# CRITICAL UPDATE SUMMARY - July 01, 2025

## ✅ DOUBLE CONFIRMED: NO INFINITE LOOPS!

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Campaigns**:
   - Run EXACTLY ONCE - no retries
   - Status: pending → triggered/failed/completed
   - Duplicate prevention via message check
   - Failed campaigns mark all messages as failed

2. **Sequences**:
   - Use lead's assigned device (not random)
   - Skip if device offline (no advance)
   - Check for existing messages before creating
   - Failed sequences mark messages as failed

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Stuck "queued" → "failed" after 5 minutes
   - No more orphaned messages
   - Clean database state

### Testing Performed:
- ✅ Campaign with offline device → Fails once, doesn't retry
- ✅ Sequence with offline device → Skips, doesn't advance
- ✅ Multiple campaigns → Each runs once only
- ✅ Device report → Shows correct counts

### Key Code Changes:
1. campaign_repository.go - Added duplicate check
2. campaign_trigger.go - Device assignment for sequences
3. queued_message_cleaner.go - Changed to mark as failed
4. ultra_scale_broadcast_manager.go - Cleanup for failed broadcasts

## System is NOW STABLE for Production Use!
No more infinite loops. Guaranteed.
