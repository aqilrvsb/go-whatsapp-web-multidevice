## UI Changes

### CSS Additions

## Technical Implementation

### Selection State Management
- Uses JavaScript `Set` to track selected lead IDs
- Persists selection state during filtering
- Clears selection when reloading leads

### API Integration
- Bulk delete uses multiple DELETE requests in parallel
- Bulk update uses PUT requests with partial data
- All operations maintain session authentication

### Performance
- Efficient selection tracking with Set data structure
- Batch API calls for better performance
- Visual feedback during operations

## Important Notes
1. Selection is cleared when leads are reloaded
2. Bulk operations respect current user permissions
3. All changes are immediately saved to the database
4. Confirmation required for destructive operations (delete)
