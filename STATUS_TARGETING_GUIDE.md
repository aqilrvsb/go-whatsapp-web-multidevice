# Lead Management & Status Targeting Updates

## Summary of All Changes (June 27, 2025)

### 1. Lead Management Improvements
- **Phone Format**: No + symbol (60123456789)
- **Niche**: Single (EXSTART) or multiple (EXSTART,ITADRESS)
- **Status**: Simplified to prospect/customer only
- **Additional Note**: Renamed from Journey/Notes
- **Dynamic Niche Filters**: Auto-generated from database

### 2. Lead Status Targeting (NEW!)
Campaigns and sequences can now target leads by BOTH niche AND status:

#### Campaign Targeting
- **Niche**: Target specific niches (supports comma-separated)
- **Target Status**: 
  - `all` - Send to all leads matching the niche
  - `prospect` - Only send to prospects
  - `customer` - Only send to customers

#### How It Works
1. Lead has niche: "EXSTART,ITADRESS" and status: "prospect"
2. Campaign targets niche: "ITADRESS" and status: "prospect"
3. ✅ Lead WILL receive the message (matches both criteria)

### 3. Database Changes
```sql
-- New columns added
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN target_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'all';
ALTER TABLE sequences ADD COLUMN target_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'all';
```

### 4. API Updates
- Lead creation now properly maps `journey` field to `notes`
- `GetLeadsByNicheAndStatus()` function for precise targeting
- Supports partial niche matching for comma-separated values

### 5. UI Updates
- Campaign form includes "Target Lead Status" dropdown
- Sequence form will also include status targeting
- Alert display bug fixed

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Targeted Campaign
1. **Title**: "Special Offer for New Customers"
2. **Niche**: "ITADRESS"
3. **Target Status**: "customer" (only existing customers)
4. **Message**: "Thank you for being our valued customer..."

### Lead Matching Examples
```
Lead 1: niche="EXSTART", status="prospect"
- Campaign targeting "EXSTART" + "prospect" ✅
- Campaign targeting "EXSTART" + "customer" ❌
- Campaign targeting "ITADRESS" + "prospect" ❌

Lead 2: niche="EXSTART,ITADRESS", status="customer"
- Campaign targeting "EXSTART" + "customer" ✅
- Campaign targeting "ITADRESS" + "customer" ✅
- Campaign targeting "EXSTART" + "prospect" ❌
```

## Technical Details

### Lead Repository Enhancement
```go
// Supports partial niche matching
GetLeadsByNiche("ITADRESS") returns:
- Leads with niche = "ITADRESS"
- Leads with niche = "ITADRESS,OTHER"
- Leads with niche = "OTHER,ITADRESS"
- Leads with niche = "OTHER,ITADRESS,MORE"

// New function for status filtering
GetLeadsByNicheAndStatus("ITADRESS", "prospect")
```

### Campaign Processing
1. Campaign specifies niche + target_status
2. System finds all leads matching the niche (including partial matches)
3. Filters by status if not "all"
4. Sends messages to filtered leads

## Benefits
1. **Precise Targeting**: Send campaigns to exactly who you want
2. **Better Segmentation**: Separate messages for prospects vs customers
3. **Flexible Niches**: One lead can belong to multiple niches
4. **Improved ROI**: No wasted messages to wrong audience

## Next Steps
To use the new features:
1. Update your database with the migration SQL
2. Create campaigns with specific target status
3. Leads will be automatically filtered by both niche AND status
