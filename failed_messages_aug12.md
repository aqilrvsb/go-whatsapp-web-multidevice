### Key Finding: Messages Failed BEFORE Their Scheduled Time!
The messages were scheduled for August 12 but failed on August 11. This means they were processed ~8 hours before their scheduled time.

## Breakdown by Sequence and Error

### Device: 8badb299-f1d1-493a-bddf-84cbaba1273b
**Error**: "wablas error: device disconnected, need to scan qr code again"

1. **HOT VITAC SEQUENCE**: 54 failed messages
2. **WARM VITAC SEQUENCE**: 44 failed messages  
3. **COLD VITAC SEQUENCE**: 18 failed messages
**Total**: 116 messages failed due to disconnected device

### Device: ae0096f8-6110-4e00-961b-440cc04ec00a
**Error**: "wablas error: token invalid or device expired"

1. **COLD Sequence**: 5 failed messages
2. **WARM Sequence**: 4 failed messages
**Total**: 9 messages failed due to invalid token

## Root Causes

### 1. **Timezone Issue (+8 Hours)**
The system processed messages 8 hours early because of the timezone adjustment:
```sql
AND scheduled_at <= DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 8 HOUR)
```
- Messages scheduled for Aug 12 00:05 (midnight) Malaysia time
- Were processed on Aug 11 16:05 (4 PM) UTC time
- This is exactly 8 hours early!

### 2. **Device Connection Issues**
- **Device 8badb299**: WhatsApp disconnected, needs QR code scan (116 failures)
- **Device ae0096f8**: Wablas token expired (9 failures)

## Why This Happened

1. **The +8 hour adjustment is being applied incorrectly**
   - It's meant to convert UTC to Malaysia time
   - But it's causing messages to be processed 8 hours EARLY

2. **When devices are offline, messages fail immediately**
   - No retry mechanism
   - No grace period for reconnection

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fix
1. **Fix the timezone logic** - Remove the +8 hour adjustment if MySQL is already in Malaysia timezone
2. **Reconnect the devices**:
   - Device 8badb299: Scan QR code again
   - Device ae0096f8: Refresh Wablas token

### Long-term Fix
1. **Add retry mechanism** for failed messages
2. **Check device status BEFORE processing**
3. **Fix the timezone configuration** properly
4. **Add monitoring** for device disconnections

## SQL to Find These Failed Messages
```sql
-- Find all failed messages for Aug 12
SELECT * FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
AND DATE(scheduled_at) = '2025-08-12'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;

-- Check if devices are now online
SELECT id, device_name, status, platform
FROM user_devices
WHERE id IN ('8badb299-f1d1-493a-bddf-84cbaba1273b', 
             'ae0096f8-6110-4e00-961b-440cc04ec00a');
