-- SEQUENCE TRIGGER SQL FIX SUMMARY --

IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

1. UPDATE YOUR LEAD TRIGGER:
UPDATE leads SET `trigger` = 'meow' WHERE phone = '60108924904';

2. UPDATE YOUR SEQUENCE:
UPDATE sequences 
SET `trigger` = 'meow',
    device_id = '315e4f8e-6868-4808-a3df-f75e9fce331f',
    min_delay_seconds = 10,
    max_delay_seconds = 30
WHERE name = 'meow';

3. GO CODE FILES TO FIX (add backticks around 'trigger'):

File: src/usecase/direct_broadcast_processor.go (Line ~133)
CHANGE FROM:
    SELECT id, day_number, trigger, next_trigger, trigger_delay_hours,
TO:
    SELECT id, day_number, `trigger`, next_trigger, trigger_delay_hours,

File: src/repository/sequence_repository.go (Check all queries)
- Line ~157: Add backticks to trigger
- Line ~226: Add backticks to trigger  
- Line ~257: Add backticks to trigger

File: src/ui/rest/app.go (Multiple locations)
- Line ~1996: Add backticks to trigger
- Line ~2005: Add backticks to trigger
- Line ~2115: Add backticks to trigger
- Line ~4227: Add backticks to trigger

File: src/ui/rest/team_member_handlers.go
- Line ~1043: Add backticks to trigger
- Line ~1066: Add backticks to trigger

QUICK FIX BATCH SCRIPT:
Create a file fix_trigger_keyword.bat with:

@echo off
echo Fixing trigger keyword in Go files...
powershell -Command "(Get-Content 'src\usecase\direct_broadcast_processor.go') -replace 'day_number, trigger,', 'day_number, `trigger`,' | Set-Content 'src\usecase\direct_broadcast_processor.go'"
echo Fixed direct_broadcast_processor.go
echo Please manually check and fix other files!

After fixing the Go code:
1. Rebuild the application
2. The sequence will automatically pick up your lead
3. It will create messages in broadcast_messages table
