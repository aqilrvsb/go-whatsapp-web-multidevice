# Complete Sequence Processing Fix - January 20, 2025

## ✅ All Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Duplicate Sequence Processors**
- **Problem**: BOTH old and new sequence processors were running simultaneously
  - Old: `StartTriggerProcessor()` in campaign_trigger.go
  - New: `StartSequenceTriggerProcessor()` in sequence_trigger_processor.go
- **Solution**: Disabled the old processor in rest.go

### 2. **Wrong Step Processing**
- **Problem**: Old processor was trying to activate step 4 before completing steps 1-3
- **Solution**: Disabled old processor; new processor correctly uses earliest pending step

### 3. **Wrong Device Assignment**
- **Problem**: Old processor used wrong device selection logic
- **Solution**: New processor correctly uses assigned_device_id from sequence_contacts

### 4. **Bulk Message Creation**
- **Problem**: Old processor created all messages at once
- **Solution**: New processor creates messages one-by-one as time arrives

### 5. **Updated_at Column Error**
- **Problem**: Database column didn't exist but old code tried to update it
- **Solution**: Removed column from database and disabled old code

## ✅ How the System Works Now (Correctly):

1. **Enrollment**: When lead gets trigger, ALL steps created as 'pending'
2. **Processing**: Every 10 seconds, finds earliest pending step where time <= NOW()
3. **Time Check**:
   - If time not reached → Mark as 'active' (tracking next in line)
   - If time reached → Create broadcast message → Mark 'completed'
4. **Device**: Uses assigned_device_id from sequence_contacts
5. **One-by-One**: Messages created individually, not in bulk

## ✅ Code Changes Made:

```go
// In src/cmd/rest.go - Disabled old processor:
// go usecase.StartTriggerProcessor()  // DISABLED
go usecase.StartSequenceTriggerProcessor()  // Only this runs now
```

## ✅ Database Fix Applied:
- Removed updated_at column from sequence_contacts table
- Verified no functions or triggers use updated_at

## ✅ Verification Steps:

1. Only ONE sequence processor runs now (the correct one)
2. Messages process in correct order (step 1, then 2, then 3...)
3. Uses correct assigned device from sequence_contacts
4. Creates messages one at a time as worker processes
5. No more updated_at errors

## ✅ Deployed:
- Commit: 04e25a4
- Message: "Fix sequence processing: Disable old campaign_trigger processor that was causing duplicate processing"
- Railway will auto-deploy from GitHub

The sequence system is now working correctly with the pending-first approach!
