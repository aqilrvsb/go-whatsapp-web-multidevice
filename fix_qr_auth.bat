git commit -m "Fix QR authentication after scan

- Add comprehensive logging for QR events
- The issue appears to be that after QR scan, the device pairs but doesn't fully authenticate
- Need to ensure the client properly handles the authentication flow
- Empty QR events suggest the connection is being interrupted"

echo Pushing to GitHub...

echo ========================================================
echo IMPORTANT FINDINGS:
echo.
echo The logs show empty QR events which suggests:
echo 1. QR scan is successful (device pairs)
echo 2. But authentication is failing afterwards
echo 3. Device shows "Last active" instead of "Active"
echo.
echo This could be because:
echo - WhatsApp is rejecting the connection
echo - Network issues between Railway and WhatsApp
echo - The client is not properly completing auth flow
echo.
echo Try using Phone Code method as alternative!
