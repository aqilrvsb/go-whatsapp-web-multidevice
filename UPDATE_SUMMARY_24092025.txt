Date: September 24, 2025

✅ COMPLETED TASKS:

1. TIME WINDOW EXTENSION (3 HOURS)
   --------------------------------
   • Changed from: 1 HOUR window restriction
   • Changed to: 3 HOUR window restriction
   • File modified: src/repository/broadcast_repository.go (line 165)
   • Purpose: Allow messages to recover within 3 hours instead of 1 hour
   • Benefit: Better recovery from extended system downtime

2. CHANGES PUSHED TO GITHUB
   ------------------------
   • Repository: https://github.com/aqilrvsb/go-whatsapp-web-multidevice.git

     - src/repository/broadcast_repository.go (changed time window)

3. APPLICATION REBUILT
   -------------------
   • Successfully compiled new whatsapp.exe
   • Build completed without errors

==========================================
NOTES ON FAILED MESSAGES:
==========================================
• Checked database for failed messages today (24/09/2025)
• Found 0 failed messages (already processed)
• Current status:
  - pending: 185 messages
  - processing: 5 messages
  - queued: 4 messages
  - sent: 18 messages

==========================================
WHAT THE 3-HOUR WINDOW DOES:
==========================================
The time window restriction in GetPendingMessages() ensures that:
• Only messages scheduled within the last 3 hours are picked up for processing
• Messages older than 3 hours won't be processed (to prevent very old messages from being sent)
• This allows recovery from downtime up to 3 hours
• Prevents permanently stuck messages during extended maintenance windows

==========================================
NEXT STEPS:
==========================================
1. Stop the current running whatsapp.exe application
2. Replace with the newly built whatsapp.exe
3. Restart the application
4. Monitor the logs to confirm the 3-hour window is working

==========================================
VERIFICATION:
==========================================
You can verify the change is active by checking:
• Log messages will show messages being picked up from up to 3 hours ago
• Database queries will include messages with scheduled_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 3 HOUR)
