# Contact Sync Made Manual - August 6, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Automatic Contact Sync
- **File Modified**: `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/chat_store.go`
- **What Changed**: Commented out the automatic `AutoSaveChatsToLeads` call that was triggered after WhatsApp history sync
- **Line 183-195**: Disabled the auto-sync code block
- **Added Log**: Now shows message "History sync complete. Use 'Sync Contacts' button to import contacts to leads."

### 2. Manual Sync Already Available
The manual sync functionality was already implemented:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/devices/:id/sync-contacts`
- **UI Button**: Available in Device Actions page (`/device/{id}/actions`)
- **Button Text**: "Sync Contacts to Leads"
- **Function**: Imports WhatsApp contacts from last 6 months to MySQL leads table

## How It Works Now

### Before (Automatic):
1. User scans QR code
2. WhatsApp connects and syncs history
3. System automatically imports all contacts to leads table
4. User has no control over when this happens

### After (Manual):
1. User scans QR code
2. WhatsApp connects and syncs history
3. System does NOT automatically import contacts
4. User can click "Sync Contacts to Leads" button when ready
5. Sync happens only when user wants it

## Benefits
- User has control over when to import contacts
- Can avoid importing unwanted contacts
- Can sync contacts at any time, not just after QR scan
- Reduces server load during initial connection

## Testing
1. Connect a new WhatsApp device
2. After QR scan succeeds, contacts will NOT be auto-imported
3. Go to Device Actions (`/device/{id}/actions`)
4. Click "Sync Contacts to Leads" button
5. Contacts from last 6 months will be imported
