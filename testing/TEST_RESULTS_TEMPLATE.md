## üîß How to Run These Tests

1. **Using the test script**:
   ```bash
   cd testing
   test_railway_custom.bat
   # Enter your Railway URL when prompted
   ```

2. **Manual API testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   curl -u admin:changeme123 https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/check-server
   
   # Get devices
   curl -u admin:changeme123 https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/devices
   
   # Get campaigns
   curl -u admin:changeme123 https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/campaigns
   ```

3. **Using the dashboard**:
   - Open `test_dashboard.html` in browser
   - Shows expected performance metrics

## üìä Next Steps

1. **If all tests pass**: System is ready for production use
2. **If some tests fail**: Check logs and fix identified issues
3. **Performance tuning**: Optimize based on actual metrics
