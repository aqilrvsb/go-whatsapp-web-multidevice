# Campaign Device Report Final Update - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made:

### 1. Backend Updates (Go)

#### DeviceReport Struct (`src/ui/rest/app.go`)
- Added new fields to track per-device statistics:
  - `ShouldSend`: Leads that should be sent per device
  - `DoneSend`: Successfully sent messages
  - `FailedSend`: Failed messages
  - `RemainingSend`: Pending messages

#### GetCampaignDeviceReport Function
- Added `math` import for calculations
- Calculate per-device shouldSend by dividing total shouldSend evenly among devices
- Populate new fields for each device:
  - `ShouldSend = perDeviceShouldSend` (evenly distributed)
  - `DoneSend = SuccessLeads`
  - `FailedSend = FailedLeads`
  - `RemainingSend = PendingLeads`

### 2. Frontend Updates (HTML/JavaScript)

#### Overall Statistics Section
- **Removed**: Total Broadcast Messages card
- **Updated Labels**:
  - "Active Devices" → "Online Devices"
  - "Disconnected" → "Offline Devices"
- **Layout**: Now shows 7 cards total:
  - Row 1: Total Devices, Online Devices, Offline Devices, Contacts Should Send
  - Row 2: Contacts Done Send Message, Contacts Failed Send Message, Contacts Remaining Send Message

#### Device-wise Report Table
- **New Columns**:
  - Device Name
  - Status Campaign (shows "Completed" or "In Progress")
  - Contacts Should Send
  - Contacts Done Send Message
  - Contacts Failed Send Message
  - Contacts Remaining Send Message
  - Success Rate
  - Actions

- **Status Campaign Logic**:
  - Shows "Completed" (green badge) when remaining = 0 AND should send > 0
  - Shows "In Progress" (yellow badge) otherwise

- **Success Rate Calculation**:
  - Based on (Done Send / Should Send) * 100
  - Shows percentage in progress bar

## How It Works:

1. **Overall Statistics**:
   - Shows campaign-level totals
   - Total/Online/Offline devices based on device status
   - Contact statistics from campaign broadcast stats

2. **Per-Device Statistics**:
   - Should Send: Evenly distributed among all devices
   - Done Send: Actual sent messages per device
   - Failed Send: Failed messages per device
   - Remaining Send: Pending messages per device

3. **Campaign Status per Device**:
   - Tracks if each device has completed its portion
   - Visual indicator of progress per device
   - Makes it easy to see which devices need attention

## Visual Changes:

### Before:
- Mixed terminology (Active/Disconnected, Total Leads, Pending/Success/Failed)
- Device table showed broadcast message counts only
- No clear indication of campaign completion per device

### After:
- Consistent terminology matching Campaign Summary
- Device table shows full contact statistics
- Clear campaign status indicator per device
- Success rate based on actual vs expected sends

This creates a unified experience across all reporting views with consistent metrics and terminology.
