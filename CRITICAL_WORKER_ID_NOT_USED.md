# CRITICAL ISSUE: GetPendingMessagesAndLock Not Being Used!

## Problem Confirmed:
- **0% of messages have `processing_worker_id`** - This column should be populated if GetPendingMessagesAndLock was being called
- **0% of messages have `processing_started_at`** - This timestamp should be set when a worker claims a message
- Messages scheduled for Aug 7-8 are ALL pending with NULL worker IDs

## Root Cause:
The code fix has been applied and pushed to GitHub, BUT the deployed application is not using the updated code.

## Evidence:
1. Code shows: `messages, err := p.broadcastRepo.GetPendingMessagesAndLock(deviceID, MESSAGE_BATCH_SIZE)`
2. Database shows: All `processing_worker_id` values are NULL
3. This means the deployed app is still calling the OLD function

## Solution Required:

### 1. Verify the deployment is using latest code:
- The executable `whatsapp_duplicate_fix.exe` was built
- But is the server running this version?

### 2. Check if there's another instance running:
- Maybe an old process is still running
- The new code hasn't been deployed to production

### 3. Restart the application:
- Stop all existing WhatsApp processes
- Start with the new executable

## Quick Test:
After restarting with the new code, run this SQL:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_new,
    COUNT(processing_worker_id) as with_worker_id
FROM broadcast_messages 
WHERE created_at > NOW();
```

If `with_worker_id` > 0, then the fix is working!

## The Fix IS in the code, but NOT running in production!
