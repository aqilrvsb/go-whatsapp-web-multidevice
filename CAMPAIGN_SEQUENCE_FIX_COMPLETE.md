# Campaign and Sequence MySQL Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Campaign Creation Error
- **Error**: `Error 1064: syntax error near "limit"`
- **Root Cause**: `limit` is a MySQL reserved keyword
- **Solution**: Used backticks with proper Go string concatenation: `` ` + "`limit`" + ` ``

### 2. Campaign INSERT Method
- **Error**: `sql: no rows in result set`
- **Root Cause**: Using QueryRow with Scan for INSERT (MySQL doesn't support RETURNING)
- **Solution**: Changed to use `Exec` with `LastInsertId()`

### 3. Sequence Creation with Steps
- **Issue**: Sequences were created but steps might not be saved
- **Solution**: Verified the service layer properly creates steps in a loop
- **Added**: Error logging for failed step creation

## Code Changes

### Campaign Repository
```go
// Fixed INSERT query with proper backticks for 'limit'
query := `
    INSERT INTO campaigns(..., ` + "`limit`" + `, ...)
    VALUES (?, ?, ...)
`

// Changed from QueryRow to Exec
result, err := r.db.Exec(query, ...)
id, err := result.LastInsertId()
campaign.ID = int(id)
```

### Sequence Repository
- Added error logging to CreateSequenceStep
- Verified CreateSequence and CreateSequenceStep work correctly
- Both use proper MySQL syntax

## Summary Tables Usage

Both Campaign Summary and Sequence Summary endpoints correctly use the `broadcast_messages` table:

1. **Campaign Summary** (`/api/campaigns/summary`)
   - Gets campaign statistics from campaigns table
   - Gets broadcast statistics from broadcast_messages table
   - Uses `GetCampaignBroadcastStats` which queries broadcast_messages

2. **Sequence Summary** (`/api/sequences/summary`)
   - Gets sequence statistics from sequences table
   - Gets message statistics from broadcast_messages table
   - Properly joins with sequence_contacts
