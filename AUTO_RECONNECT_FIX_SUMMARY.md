# Auto-Reconnect After Logout Fix

## Problem
When clicking logout on a device, it would:
1. Show "Device Logged Out!" modal
2. Device shows as disconnected
3. After 5 seconds, device automatically reconnects
4. Device shows as connected again without user action

## Root Cause
Multiple auto-reconnect mechanisms were preventing proper logout:

1. **Ultra Stable Connection** - Ignored logout events and forced immediate reconnection
2. **Auto Reconnect Service** - Tried to reconnect all offline devices every 5 minutes
3. **Connection Manager** - Attempted to reclaim lost connections
4. **Health Monitor** - Reconnected devices that appeared offline

All these systems were designed to keep devices connected but didn't respect intentional logouts.

## Solution - Logout Tracker

Created a `LogoutTracker` system that:
1. **Tracks intentional logouts** - Marks devices when user clicks logout
2. **Prevents auto-reconnect** - All reconnect mechanisms check this tracker
3. **24-hour timeout** - Logout flag expires after 24 hours
4. **Clears on reconnect** - Flag removed when user scans QR to reconnect

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Created `tracker/logout_tracker.go`
```go
type LoggedOutTracker struct {
    loggedOut map[string]time.Time // deviceID -> logout time
}
```

#### 2. Updated Enhanced Logout
- Marks device in tracker when logout initiated
- Ensures device won't auto-reconnect

#### 3. Updated All Auto-Reconnect Points
- `ultra_stable_connection.go` - Checks tracker before reconnecting
- `auto_reconnect.go` - Skips logged out devices
- `connection_manager.go` - Respects logout status
- `maintainConnection()` - Stops maintenance for logged out devices

#### 4. Clear Flag on Reconnect
- When user clicks to scan QR, logout flag is cleared
- Allows manual reconnection when user wants

## Testing

1. **Connect a device** - Scan QR code
2. **Click Logout** - Device shows as disconnected
3. **Wait 10+ seconds** - Device stays disconnected (no auto-reconnect)
4. **Click Scan QR** - Can manually reconnect when desired

## Files Modified

1. `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/tracker/logout_tracker.go` - New tracker system
2. `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/enhanced_logout.go` - Mark device as logged out
3. `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/stability/ultra_stable_connection.go` - Check logout status
4. `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/auto_reconnect.go` - Skip logged out devices
5. `src/infrastructure/whatsapp/connection_manager.go` - Respect logout flag
6. `src/ui/rest/device_multidevice.go` - Clear flag on reconnect

The logout functionality now works correctly - devices stay logged out until user manually reconnects!
