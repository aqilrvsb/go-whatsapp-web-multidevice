# Self-Healing Architecture - Final Implementation

## Key Features

### 1. Platform-Aware Refresh
- **Platform devices** (Wablas, Whacenter, etc): Skip refresh, use external API
- **WhatsApp devices** (platform is null): Use self-healing refresh

### 2. Refresh Logic (Same as UI Button)
The worker refresh uses the exact same logic as the working refresh button:
1. Check if device has JID (previous session)
2. Query `whatsmeow_sessions` table for session data
3. Create WhatsApp container and get device
4. Connect with stored session
5. Register with ClientManager and DeviceManager

### 3. Message Flow

```
SendMessage(deviceID, message)
    â†“
Device has platform? 
    â†“ Yes                      â†“ No
Send via External API     GetOrRefreshClient()
(Wablas/Whacenter)             â†“
                          Client healthy?
                               â†“ No
                          Refresh from DB
                               â†“
                          Send via WhatsApp
```

## Code Structure

### WhatsAppMessageSender.SendMessage()
```go
if device.Platform != "" {
    // Send via external platform API
    return platformSender.SendMessage(...)
}
// Only WhatsApp devices go through refresh
return sendViaWhatsApp(deviceID, msg)
```

### WorkerClientManager.GetOrRefreshClient()
```go
// Platform devices don't need refresh
if device.Platform != "" {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("platform device - no client needed")
}

// Only refresh WhatsApp devices (platform is null)
// Uses same logic as UI refresh button
```

## Benefits

1. **Efficient**: Platform devices skip unnecessary refresh
2. **Reliable**: WhatsApp devices get fresh connections
3. **Consistent**: Same logic as working UI refresh button
4. **Scalable**: Handles 3000+ mixed devices (platform + WhatsApp)

## Testing

To verify it's working:
1. Platform devices should show: `[PLATFORM-SEND] Sending message via Wablas`
2. WhatsApp devices should show: `ðŸ”„ Refreshing WhatsApp device...`
3. No refresh attempts for platform devices
