# Quick Implementation Guide (Code Only - No Migration)

## Files to Update

### 1. Replace Sequence Trigger Processor

Replace the existing `sequence_trigger_processor.go` with the optimized version from:
```
improvements/optimized_sequence_trigger_processor.go
```

### 2. Update Imports

Make sure to add the `math/rand` import if not already present:
```go
import (
    "math/rand"
    // ... other imports
)
```

### 3. Key Changes in the Optimized Version

- **No retry logic** - Single attempt only
- **Individual flow tracking** - Uses `sequence_stepid`
- **100 workers** for parallel processing
- **10,000 batch size** for 3000 devices
- **Random delays** between min/max seconds
- **Smart device selection** with load balancing
- **Schedule time checking** with 10-minute window

### 4. Device Load Tracking

The processor now updates `device_load_balance` table after each message:
```go
// Updates hourly and daily counters
s.updateDeviceLoad(deviceID)
```

### 5. Flow Status Management

- `pending` - Flow not yet ready
- `active` - Ready to send
- `sent` - Successfully sent
- `failed` - Failed (no retry)
- `completed` - Sequence finished

### 6. Monitor Performance

Check these views for monitoring:
```sql
-- Device loads
SELECT * FROM device_performance_monitor;

-- Sequence progress
SELECT * FROM sequence_progress_monitor;

-- Failed flows
SELECT * FROM failed_flows_monitor;
```

## Quick Start

1. Copy the optimized processor to your codebase
2. Update the processor initialization in your main app
3. Restart the application
4. Monitor logs for performance metrics

The system will automatically start processing sequences with the new optimized logic!
